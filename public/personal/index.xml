      <description>For fun, I like to walk, run, hike, backpack, kayak and ride my bicycles: a foldable touring Bike Friday, a Specialized Hybrid that I sometimes use to commute to work, a Specialized Allez road bike, and stoker-willing, a road tandem we call Tonya. Last summer, my wife and I took a tour of southern Tuscany with Vermont Bicycle Tours (VBT).</description>

      <description>My family and I have been involved theatre and music for a very long time. Indeed, my wife and I met in a production of &amp;ldquo;South Pacific&amp;rdquo; with the Georgetown Gilbert &amp;amp; Sullivan Society (GG&amp;amp;SS).
Recent shows here in State College have included &amp;ldquo;Oliver!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Sound of Music,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sweeney Todd,&amp;rdquo; with Singing Onstage, &amp;ldquo;Dracula&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Survivor&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Gypsy&amp;rdquo; with the State College Community Theatre (SCCT), and &amp;ldquo;The Memory of Water&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Harper Regan&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Two Can Play&amp;rdquo; with The Next Stage theatre company.</description>

      <description>I was licensed as a Tech+ in 1993, but was never really active. Kids and finishing grad school were higher priorities. After reading &amp;ldquo;Seveneves,&amp;rdquo; I got the bug again and took both the Technician and General in the space of a couple of weeks in the summer of 2016. With the moral support of some fellow club members and a helpful Elmer, I upgraded to Extra in July of 2017.</description>

      <description>Some rascal or rogue Stashed kryptonite Upon my person.
Perhaps in that fingertip pocket of my Leviâ€™s, Or the underside of the spare button on that green and black plaid shirt, Or the tunnel in my underwear that no man uses I assure you but most boys try at least once.
I have always loved flying And nerdy girls. I have been underestimated by villains, And see beneath the surfaces of things.</description>

      <description>I have been involved in local politics, serving as clerk and Judge of Elections in my State College precinct and now Majority Inspector. I was a moderate Republican at one point, but changed parties after the 2000 election.
My wife and I were formerly Democratic Precinct Co-chairs.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially proud of the work that led to the construction of the Bellefonte Central Rail Trail. It was one of our community&amp;rsquo;s constructive responses to 9&amp;frasl;11.</description>

      <description>taunts of bad hair boy-men transfix the play yard. mine is bigger. no mine. look.
there is no alternative channel for the cartoon among nations.
our smiley wiley has chased some tail feather off a cliff and stands now unbound by ground, animation suspended.
&amp;lsquo;tis only a matter of time until the forces of nature overcome their shock at the effrontery and shame gravity to reassert its inevitable grasp on matter and mass.</description>

      <description>sometimes late in the 4th quarter you&#39;re down a score, out of timeouts, and it&#39;s 4th and long.
on the line is your whole season
or your job
or your life.
and you throw the Hail Mary toward that one corner of the endzone where your receivers just might beat the cornerbacks in a jump ball or a volleyball tip, and two feet just might land in bounds, and the crowd just might roar, and you just might reach to the sky in triumph, and your tears just might be ones of joy.</description>

      <description>oh my, yes. I oh so wanted to see a tuxedo, penguin crisp, satin shiny, pseudo-sparkle when he sauntered by us peons, clinging to such rags as misfortune left in her cloud of dust and tears. Coughing.
but, oh my no. no. Clad there not in finery, but in the simplest of suits. Birthday I am told the style. Flattered, but not flattering. Scoffing, not coughing.
And in seeing I could not unsee, despite I swear so wanting, you must believe, Nor in knowing could I unknow what what wisdom bears in its stoop and beard the penultimate emptiness of every emperor, penguin or man.</description>

      <description>I flare my talons and prepare to strike, but only in defense. I sharpen my beak, but only in warning.
I am your presidential detail, your Secret Service. Vigilant. Committed. I seek out bullets fired in your direction by indifferent snipers and absorb their impact with joy. Unwounded.
I will carry your heart when it cannot be lifted. I will find you when you are lost even to yourself. I will light your darkness with the fire in my eyes, and we will crawl together out of the wilderness.</description>

      <description>it&#39;s like fireworks, dad. you said the colors and patterns come from all the minerals. their making a mutual arrangement designed to ignite and illuminate.  you said the designers crafted this one boomy blue and that one sparkly-white. this cascade brilliant, that smiley face a dud.  flying high or bursting low, it&#39;s all in the timing and atmospheric conditions. don&#39;t forget chemistry and physics. human ingenuity (and error).</description>

      <description>sweet land of liberty of thee i sing
the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did: unreasonable searches and seizures deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process.
o say can you see by the dawn&#39;s early light that a house divided against itself cannot stand; that bravura is not bravery.
this land is your land, this land is my land.</description>

      <description>I strangled hope. Smug bastard annoyed me. I spring eternal; there is always room for me, he&#39;d say (or his fanboys would moonily recite). So I grabbed his throat and fingers clenched squeezed. his eyes bulged green then withered gray. he lay dishrag limp on my lap. I hissed a firehose sigh, a contrail marking passage across some cloudless sky and felt don&#39;t laugh full of...
Persistent bastard. Kill you again if I have the chance.</description>

      <description>Who knows how to unmake love? that fertile ground for growing goodness in tiny cracks between beings. Passionate demands attention, but draws reluctant admiration for his gymnastic stamina and singularity of focus -- a laser light later scattered in time&#39;s gauze. Oh so cute I could pinch the cheeks of this Puppy she says 40 Years Married now. Others applaud politely if not quite aspiring to such longevity. Unrequited garners the requisite sympathy.</description>

      <description>My unicorn Is patron saint of regret. He holds dominion over Things wished-for but not received. the unfulfilled, unrequited, unrealized.
Get it? He says, I&#39;m like a Magritte or an Escher. Self-referential.
I don&#39;t. Or, I do, but I&#39;m wallowing.
Quite unselfservingly, He says I should shun the vaporous un.... and rather mind those things I got but did not think to wish for.

They don&#39;t wear wings, you know. Impractical indoors. Hard to fit under a winter coat. Showy. Too many feathers ruffled already.
Or halos. Lord knows we have enough of those.
Sensible shoes? You bet. Got to keep their footing sure.
Craig or Suzanne might play a little trumpet, but only in the municipal band.
And none of them want to wrestle, ok?</description>

in such a frictionless state we are thought experiments in Schrodinger&#39;s sanctuary, simultaneously alive and dead, both and neither, statistically speaking. let us out of the box to end the mystery; measure our true state at your peril and ours.
novices idealize its positions, velocities, accelerations of different centers of mass. meanwhile the conservation of momentum, the history of trajectories of particles in collision, demonstrates the superiority of this calculus over that algebra.</description>

      <description>I used to envy those who carried their hearts safe surrounded by the warm fellowship of other organs.
worn on the sleeve mine fits no item of clothing, so rides exposed, bumping into this sharp-edged tongue, or that pointed remark.
but a bleeding heart is never really broken, and worn there it escapes its ribbed-cage.
on the lam, its every beat sucks in sorrow, pumps out sweetness, the flow of life and its ebb.</description>
