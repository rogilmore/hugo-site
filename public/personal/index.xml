      <description>For fun, I like to walk, run, hike, backpack, kayak and ride my bicycles: a foldable touring Bike Friday, a Specialized Hybrid that I sometimes use to commute to work, a Specialized Allez road bike, and stoker-willing, a road tandem we call Tonya. Last summer, my wife and I took a tour of southern Tuscany with Vermont Bicycle Tours (VBT).</description>

      <description>My family and I have been involved theatre and music for a very long time. Indeed, my wife and I met in a production of &amp;ldquo;South Pacific&amp;rdquo; with the Georgetown Gilbert &amp;amp; Sullivan Society (GG&amp;amp;SS).
Recent shows here in State College have included &amp;ldquo;Oliver!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Sound of Music,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sweeney Todd,&amp;rdquo; with Singing Onstage, &amp;ldquo;Dracula&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Survivor&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Gypsy&amp;rdquo; with the State College Community Theatre (SCCT), and &amp;ldquo;The Memory of Water&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Harper Regan&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Two Can Play&amp;rdquo; with The Next Stage theatre company.</description>

      <description>I was licensed as a Tech+ in 1993, but was never really active. Kids and finishing grad school were higher priorities. After reading &amp;ldquo;Seveneves,&amp;rdquo; I got the bug again and took both the Technician and General in the space of a couple of weeks in the summer of 2016. With the moral support of some fellow club members and a helpful Elmer, I upgraded to Extra in July of 2017.</description>

      <description>Some rascal or rogue Stashed kryptonite Upon my person.
Perhaps in that fingertip pocket of my Leviâ€™s, Or the underside of the spare button on that green and black plaid shirt, Or the tunnel in my underwear that no man uses I assure you but most boys try at least once.
I have always loved flying And nerdy girls. I have been underestimated by villains, And see beneath the surfaces of things.</description>

      <description>I have been involved in local politics, serving as clerk and Judge of Elections in my State College precinct and now Majority Inspector. I was a moderate Republican at one point, but changed parties after the 2000 election.
My wife and I were formerly Democratic Precinct Co-chairs.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially proud of the work that led to the construction of the Bellefonte Central Rail Trail. It was one of our community&amp;rsquo;s constructive responses to 9&amp;frasl;11.</description>
