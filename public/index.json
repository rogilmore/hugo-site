The following is a draft response my colleagues and I are working on.\nDear Dr. Bianchi:\nThank you for the opportunity to respond to the NICHD Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020-2024. We write as Principal Investigators of the Play \u0026amp; Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project (R01HD094830), a 65-researcher-strong video-based study of natural infant/mother behavior, funded by NICHD, NIMH, OBSSSR, and the Office of the Director. Our recommendation is simple: We urge you and your colleagues to incorporate a clear vision for behavioral research in the plan\u0026rsquo;s research themes and goals to underscore the pivotal importance of behavior and experience in child development.\nBehavior is the linchpin of the most vexing problems in public health, and a better understanding of behavior is fundamental to achieving positive health outcomes, from prenatal development throughout adulthood. Behavior contributes to the progression or prevention of disease, defines a disorder or marks recovery, and provides mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. The study of child health and human development magnifies this importance. According to the CDC, two of the three leading causes of death among children aged 1-4 (accidents and assault/homicide) and children aged 5- 14 (accidents and suicide) involve behavior, among other factors. One child in six has a developmental disability. The most common developmental disabilities—autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sensory impairments—substantially impact behaviors across the lifespan, and often the most effective interventions are behavioral. Virtually every problem in children, families, and society—substance use, school violence, school dropout, ethnic disparities, emotional dysregulation, racism and discrimination, and more—can be traced to behaviors and experiences in childhood. Moreover, the growing field of epigenetics reveals that genetics data alone provide limited insights about developmental outcomes without critical information about early experiences, behaviors, and environments.\nIn the context of the NICHD 2020-2024 Strategic plan, our specific recommendations are as follows. In Research Theme #1—understanding early human development—we ask that you expand the focus beyond genetic and cellular levels of analysis and incorporate maternal and fetal behavior as central phenomena that need to be studied and understood. Similarly, regarding Research Theme #2—setting the stage for a healthy pregnancy—we ask that you expand the focus to include maternal and other caregiver behaviors, including paternal behaviors, that may reduce or elevate risk. Research Theme #4—identifying sensitive time periods to optimize health interventions—highlights the role of behavior. However, the plan implies that we have sufficient knowledge about the varied trajectories of typical development to productively intervene in atypical development. This may be true in a limited set of domains, but is not broadly true in our experience. Much more research about behavioral development is needed. Our suggestion about Research Theme #5—Improving health during the transition from adolescence to adulthood—is to broaden the lens to include research on childhood behaviors observed in a variety of settings that serve as precursors to risk in adolescence.\nWe wish to emphasize that many standardized laboratory tasks or parent-report questionnaire instruments thought to reliably reflect the \u0026ldquo;phenotype,\u0026rdquo; fail to capture vital dimensions of infant, child, adolescent, and parent behavior that occur in natural settings. Indeed, this gap motivates our focus on video in the PLAY project. Natural behavior in home, school, and clinical settings can be reliably and informatively captured and analyzed using video. And we have shown that video can be securely and ethically shared using tools for video informatics (Databrary and Datavyu) and policies for restricted data sharing with explicit consent that we have developed and shared with the research community thanks to NICHD support (U01HD076595).\nThe PLAY project capitalizes on these advances in an effort to capture, analyze, and openly share data about the building blocks of infant and maternal behavior combining video with other data sources. PLAY is motivated in part by the belief that the hard-won knowledge gleaned from public funding for the genome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome initiatives will have substantially greater impact on child and maternal health outcomes when combined with insights from a corresponding \u0026ldquo;behaviorome.\u0026rdquo; As a \u0026ldquo;behaviorome\u0026rdquo;-like research effort, PLAY aims to accelerate the pace of discovery in basic and applied developmental science. NICHD has a strong track record of funding research on infant and child behavior. Given the essential role of behavior in maternal, child, and adolescent health, we urge NICHD to build upon this tradition by giving the study of behavior substantially greater emphasis and visibility in the 2020-2024 strategic plan and beyond.\nYours truly,\nKaren Adolph, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, New York University\nRick O.

Mental experience \u0026ndash; thoughts and feelings \u0026ndash; are also common targets of inquiry.\nI recently went looking for a systematic catalogue of behaviors that should, in theory, constitute the substance of what psychologists and other behavioral scientists study. My goal was to take that catalogue as a starting point for thinking about the relationship between information available for perception and the actions (behaviors) that this information informs. The formal term for this sort of catalog is an \u0026lsquo;ethogram\u0026rsquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sample template from the Tree of Life project. Unfortunately, I failed in my quest.\nThere have been attempts to create and openly share animal ethograms like the apparently stalled or inactive ethobank.org site associated with the EthoSource project. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology and the Cognitive Atlas project attempt to create systematic ontologies (systematic representations of categories and concepts and their relations) of tasks used in experimental psychology. Cognitive psychology tasks clearly require very specific types of behavior from participants. Systematically organizing the nature of these tasks should lead to faster progress in understanding how they relate to one another, and ultimately, how minds and brains actually work. Still, I came up short in finding a comprehensive human ethogram.\nIn other contexts, I\u0026rsquo;ve called such a thing the behaviorome, partly to suggest that behavior should have a more central place in research grantmaking priorities. The PLAY project is a type of behaviorome effort. We will be creating detailed definitions for specific behaviors that our infant and adult participants produce in a small set of behavioral domains, but it will not be comprehensive by any means. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m stuck with trying to assemble my own.\nOne approach to an ethogram for humans could focus on biologically essential behavioral classes that we share with all other animals: ingestion (food and nutrient seeking), defense (self-protection), and reproduction. Unfortunately, this scheme fail to capture the sets of behaviors studied by the majority of psychologists. Adding in a class of communicative and affiliative behaviors helps. But even this augmented classification describes the functional purposes of behavior, not the behaviors themselves. For example, locomotor behavior, moving toward or away from some target, occurs in food seeking, predator avoidance, mate seeking, and social (affiliative) contexts.\nAnother way to ask the question is to observe whether physical activities that humans do for pleasure and watch others for entertainment (sports) have some latent structure we might exploit. Here, we assume that if large groups of humans engage in an activity or pay to watch others engage in it, the skills involved must be especially demanding. Indeed, professional sports represent some of humankind\u0026rsquo;s most skilled (and highly paid) actors. And while I\u0026rsquo;m still looking for a comprehensive catalog of sport types, this table shows that most of them fall into a small set of categories when focusing on the core actions that define success.\n   Category Sports     aiming basketball, baseball, football (passing \u0026amp; kicking), hocky, soccer, bowling, tennis, golf, pool/billiards, archery, \u0026hellip;   steering slalom skiing, motorsports   performing gymnastics, diving, synchronized swimming, figure skating, \u0026hellip;   racing running, motorsports, speed skating, swimming, cycling, paddling   fighting boxing, wrestling, \u0026hellip;   feats of strength weightlifting    You may disagree with my categorization, but I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll agree that there are many similarities in the sorts of actions we find entertaining to watch.\nAnother approach to an ethogram starts with the actions that computer vision researchers find are important to extract from video. Google’s Atomic Visual Action (AVA) dataset (https://research.google.com/ava/) involves three classes of movements, person movement, object interaction, person interaction, and has exemplars with 81 specific actions that fit into these categories. Some examples of specific behaviors tagged in the AVA dataset are crawl, dance, jump/leap, lift, open, press, hug, kiss, and listen to.\nMaybe some combination of these approaches is as good a start as any. After all, if behavioral biologists don\u0026rsquo;t seem to agree about what constitutes behavior, it\u0026rsquo;s not that surprising that psychologists haven\u0026rsquo;t yet created our own list. We do need a list like this, though, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\n","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"58942c33dbdf4bd52c14fb0f3af82897","permalink":"/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/","section":"post","summary":"Psychology is in part, a science of behavior.

In short, there are a handful of perception/action systems that provide the nervous system with deterministic, causal information about the effects of different actions. These must be important for development.\nFor the next step, I’m looking for a concise, but thorough parameterization of body posture that includes the eyes, head, torso, arms, and legs.

Now, if the visual signals from eye vs. head vs. torso can be distinguished, then these could couple with other proprioceptive (muscle, tendon, cutaneous) signals to provide a powerful set of sensory signals that are directly caused by eye, head, and torso motion. See this earlier post for a causal graph that elaborates on this point. I’ll discuss why I think there are visual differences in the effects of eye and head motion in a future post.\nMy next step is to ask my colleagues in kinesiology if there is a canonical parameterization of body position that I can build upon.

Eye movements stem from eye movement commands; head movements (translations and rotations) stem from head movement commands; body movements stem from commands to move the body. Movements of the eyes, head, or body generate proprioceptive signals from the eyes, head, and body. These signals derive from muscle, joint, and tendon receptors. Rotational and translational motion of the head stimulates vestibular signals.\nNote that retinal motion caused by the observer has multiple non-visual correlates (or consequences) that are detectable under typical circumstances. There may also be differences in the specific properties of motion caused by eye, head, body, or object motion.

But I never pushed or insisted, and so it never happened.\nThen, as a byproduct of a bunch of reading I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing about causal modeling and the philosophy of science, I came up with a figure that seems to work on several levels.\nThe outer circle represents the world, the next circle the body that is embedded in the world, the next the nervous system embedded in that body (in the world), and the smallest the mind embedded in the brain (in the body in the world). The world, body, and brain are directly measurable in various ways. The mind is not. We infer properties and structures of the mind indirectly, through patterns of brain activity or peripheral physiology or behavior. The focal point of psychology as a science is making inferences about something that cannot be directly measured. This is one reason psychology is harder than physics.\nThe figure has other associations. It is similar to one used to demonstrate that rotational motion in 2 dimensions can evoke the perception of an object in 3 dimensions \u0026ndash; something called the stereokinetic depth effect (SKE). It evokes the perception of a cone-like shape protruding up and to the left. And it evokes a weaker perception of a tunnel. I study depth perception and motion perception, so these features make the figure even more appealing.\nFinally, the figure could be viewed as a large letter O, for openness, something I now embrace in all aspects of my scholarship.\nI confess that I was just trying a new way to depict the embedded causal relationships among mind, brain, body, and the environment and found a color scheme I liked. The rest was purely accidental.

If you’re curious, you can download the databraryapi package from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi.\nLike many people in the software world, I’m entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience. But my R package development skills are entirely self-taught. I must thank the incredibly generous geniuses who have gone before me and who share their code and their talents so freely and openly. Without the almost instant availability of these resources, my progress would be much, much slower.\nDevelopers are an opinionated bunch, and there are at least as many styles (fads?) in software development as their are developers. One style that I have started to try to emulate is ‘test-driven development’. In TDD, the idea is that you create tests for how each part of your package should respond given this or that input. If your tests are through enough and correct, your package should work…at least within the boundaries of what you tested.\nFor the latest version of the package (0.1.4), I added a bunch of new tests to evaluate several new functions I’ve added to the package. Let’s just say that getting through my own self-designed test battery was challenging. But as a result, the code is cleaner and less buggy than it would be if I hadn’t gone this route.\nIn the larger sense, TDD is sort of a “plan for the worst” style. I like it because I know it forces me to be more precise and specific than I might otherwise choose to be. Since I’ve been using the databraryapi more often for keeping tabs on what’s going on in the Databrary world, that’s a very good thing.\nIn case you’re curious what the package can do, check this out:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi\u0026quot;) ## Skipping install of \u0026#39;databraryapi\u0026#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (a6a700ea) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation Here is a list of some recently authorized researchers:\ndatabraryapi::get_db_stats(\u0026quot;people\u0026quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## id sortname prename affiliation url institution ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; ## 1 4744 Tadepalli Prasad Oregon State University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 2 4871 Black Jessica Jan Saint Vincent College \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 3 4477 Prull Matthew Whitman College \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 4 753 Childers Jane Trinity University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 5 4881 Lindskog Marcus Uppsala University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 6 4852 Hudson Danae Missouri State University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA And here is a very simple plot of the growth in authorized researchers and institutions over time:\nwith(databraryapi::read_csv_data_as_df(), plot(Auth_Investigators, Institutions)) ## No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.

In this article, we discuss some of the challenges to open sharing and offer practical solutions for researchers who wish to share more of the products?and process?of their research. Many of these solutions were devised by the Databrary.org data library for storing and sharing video, audio, and other forms of sensitive or personally identifiable data. We also discuss ways in which researchers can make shared data and materials easier for others to find and reuse. Widely adopted, these solutions and practices will increase transparency and speed progress in psychological science.","tags":["open science","data sharing","Databrary"],"title":"Practical solutions for sharing data and materials from psychological research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"taunts of bad hair boy-men transfix the play yard. mine is bigger. no mine. look.\nthere is no alternative channel for the cartoon among nations.\nour smiley wiley has chased some tail feather off a cliff and stands now unbound by ground, animation suspended.\n\u0026lsquo;tis only a matter of time until the forces of nature overcome their shock at the effrontery and shame gravity to reassert its inevitable grasp on matter and mass.\nBut what then goes before the fall?

For example, findings from developmental and vision science have spurred recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how artificial intelligence and computer vision can facilitate research in developmental science. The current study presents AutoViDev—an automatic video-analysis tool that uses machine learning and computer vision to support video-based developmental research. AutoViDev identifies full body position estimations in real-time video streams using convolutional pose machine-learning algorithms. AutoViDev provides valuable information about a variety of behaviors, including gaze direction, facial expressions, posture, locomotion, manual actions, and interactions with objects. We present a high-level architecture of the framework and describe two projects that demonstrate its usability. We discuss the benefits of applying AutoViDev to large-scale, shared video datasets and highlight how machine learning and computer vision can enhance and accelerate research in developmental science.","tags":["AI","computer vision","data science","video","Databrary"],"title":"AutoViDev: A computer-vision framework to enhance and accelerate research in human development","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
