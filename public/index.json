I thought that designing a logo was something that some student might actually enjoy doing. But I never pushed or insisted, and so it never happened.\nThen, as a byproduct of a bunch of reading I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing about causal modeling and the philosophy of science, I came up with a figure that seems to work on several levels, at least to me.\nThe outer circle represents the world, the next circle the body that is embedded in the world, the next the nervous system embedded in that body (in the world), and the smallest the mind embedded in the brain (in the body in the world). The world, body, and brain are directly measurable in various ways. The mind is not. We infer properties and structures of the mind indirectly, through patterns of brain activity or peripheral physiology or behavior. The focal point of psychology as a science is making inferences about something that cannot be directly measured. This is one reason psychology is harder than physics.\nThe figure has other associations. It is similar to one used to demonstrate that rotational motion in 2 dimensions can evoke the perception of an object in 3 dimensions \u0026ndash; something called the stereokinetic depth effect (SKE). It evokes the perception of a cone-like shape protruding up and to the left. And it evokes a weaker perception of a tunnel. I study depth perception and motion perception, so these features make the figure even more appealing.\nFinally, the figure could be viewed as a large letter O, for openness, something I now embrace in all aspects of my scholarship.\nI confess that I was just trying a new way to depict the embedded causal relationships among mind, brain, body, and the environment and found a color scheme I liked. The rest was purely accidental.

If you’re curious, you can download the databraryapi package from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi.\nLike many people in the software world, I’m entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience. But my R package development skills are entirely self-taught. I must thank the incredibly generous geniuses who have gone before me and who share their code and their talents so freely and openly. Without the almost instant availability of these resources, my progress would be much, much slower.\nDevelopers are an opinionated bunch, and there are at least as many styles (fads?) in software development as their are developers. One style that I have started to try to emulate is ‘test-driven development’. In TDD, the idea is that you create tests for how each part of your package should respond given this or that input. If your tests are through enough and correct, your package should work…at least within the boundaries of what you tested.\nFor the latest version of the package (0.1.4), I added a bunch of new tests to evaluate several new functions I’ve added to the package. Let’s just say that getting through my own self-designed test battery was challenging. But as a result, the code is cleaner and less buggy than it would be if I hadn’t gone this route.\nIn the larger sense, TDD is sort of a “plan for the worst” style. I like it because I know it forces me to be more precise and specific than I might otherwise choose to be. Since I’ve been using the databraryapi more often for keeping tabs on what’s going on in the Databrary world, that’s a very good thing.\nIn case you’re curious what the package can do, check this out:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi\u0026quot;) ## Skipping install of \u0026#39;databraryapi\u0026#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (a6a700ea) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation Here is a list of some recently authorized researchers:\ndatabraryapi::get_db_stats(\u0026quot;people\u0026quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## id sortname prename affiliation url institution ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; ## 1 4744 Tadepalli Prasad Oregon State University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 2 4871 Black Jessica Jan Saint Vincent College \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 3 4477 Prull Matthew Whitman College \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 4 753 Childers Jane Trinity University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 5 4881 Lindskog Marcus Uppsala University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 6 4852 Hudson Danae Missouri State University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA And here is a very simple plot of the growth in authorized researchers and institutions over time:\nwith(databraryapi::read_csv_data_as_df(), plot(Auth_Investigators, Institutions)) ## No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.

Widely adopted, these solutions and practices will increase transparency and speed progress in psychological science.","tags":["open science","data sharing","Databrary"],"title":"Practical solutions for sharing data and materials from psychological research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Karen Adolph and I co-founded Databrary.org, a data library specialized for securely storing, streaming, and sharing video and audio recordings for use as data and documentation.\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"debe2bd7a6987231587be3255631a6be","permalink":"/project/databrary.org/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/databrary.org/","section":"project","summary":"An open, secure data library for sharing video.","tags":["video","open science","data sharing"],"title":"Databrary.org","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Datavyu.org is a free open-source tool for video and audio annotation.\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"3fe4fc873c3b3f01db37caf4453a73a9","permalink":"/project/datavyu.org/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/datavyu.org/","section":"project","summary":"An open source tool for video annotation.","tags":["video","open science","data sharing","annotation"],"title":"Datavyu.org","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"8e12f9e532b4e6f15b657f3fafa42faf","permalink":"/project/peep/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/peep/","section":"project","summary":"What is the emotional environment really like?","tags":["emotion","perception","audition","Matlab"],"title":"Proximal Emotional Environment Project (PEEP)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ori Ossmy","Rick O.

For example, findings from developmental and vision science have spurred recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how artificial intelligence and computer vision can facilitate research in developmental science. The current study presents AutoViDev—an automatic video-analysis tool that uses machine learning and computer vision to support video-based developmental research. AutoViDev identifies full body position estimations in real-time video streams using convolutional pose machine-learning algorithms. AutoViDev provides valuable information about a variety of behaviors, including gaze direction, facial expressions, posture, locomotion, manual actions, and interactions with objects. We present a high-level architecture of the framework and describe two projects that demonstrate its usability. We discuss the benefits of applying AutoViDev to large-scale, shared video datasets and highlight how machine learning and computer vision can enhance and accelerate research in developmental science.","tags":["AI","computer vision","data science","video","Databrary"],"title":"AutoViDev: A computer-vision framework to enhance and accelerate research in human development","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
