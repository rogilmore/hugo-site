When I first heard about ham radio as a boy, the thrills were mostly about talking by voice and CW (Morse code) to stations around the world. Now there are dozens of digital (computer-to-computer) modes, styles of operating, and bands to operate on.\nI learned a bit of Morse code back when I was first licensed in 1993. But in my second reincarnation as a ham, the code requirements had been dropped, and so there was no compelling reason to learn it. Except that I wanted to. For reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t quite understand, I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to learn skills that don\u0026rsquo;t have much practical use but have a venerable history and still attract enthusiasts.

Or alternatively, I have to adjust my expectations about how much progress I\u0026rsquo;ll see with the amount of work I put in.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also humbling, but gratifying to be on the other side of the teaching lectern.

While research has emphasized facial emotion expressions, children are also constantly required to interpret vocal emotion expressed at or around them by individuals who are both familiar and unfamiliar to them. The present study examined how speaker familiarity, specific emotions, and the acoustic properties that comprise affective prosody influenced children’s interpretations of emotional intensity. Participants were 51 7- and 8-year-olds presented with speech stimuli spoken in happy, angry, sad, and non-emotional prosodies by both the child’s mother and another child’s mother, unfamiliar to the target child. Analyses indicated that children rated their own mothers as more intensely emotional compared to the unfamiliar mothers, and that this effect was specific to angry and happy prosodies. Further, the acoustic properties predicted children’s emotional intensity ratings in different patterns for each emotion. The results are discussed in terms of the significance of the mother’s voice in children’s development of emotional understanding.","tags":["emotion","environment","data sharing"],"title":"I know that voice!

Are we one Nation of many, including diverse and discrepant views on religious questions, racial and ethnic backgrounds, languages and cultures, or are we something else, something, well, smaller? I know that loud voices in our land today and among our leaders want to expel the different and shun the diverse, to make us smaller, more homogeneous.

As examples, Redish et al. summarize the history of the Four Color Theorem, the claim that Fourier series can characterize any function, and the conditions under which neural networks can carry out certain computations. I find useful these reminders from mathematics and computer science that progress and regress are essential parts of the trajectory of scientific discovery, but I find unconvincing arguments that \u0026lsquo;many of the current concerns about reproducibility overlook the dynamic, iterative nature of the process of discovery.\u0026rsquo;\nAccording to a 2016 survey in Nature, some 90% of scientists surveyed agreed that \u0026lsquo;there is a reproducibility crisis.\u0026rsquo; Sixty to eighty percent of scientists in fields from chemistry to earth and environmental sciences reported failing to reproduce someone else\u0026rsquo;s experiment, and 40-60% reported failing to reproduce their own experiments. Respondents expressed widely-ranging opinions about \u0026lsquo;how much published work in your field is reproducible?\u0026rsquo; Curiously, physicists and chemists were most confident in the literature AND most likely to report having failed to reproduce a study. Perhaps chemists and physicists are more likely to attempt to reproduce published results than scientists in other fields.\nRedish et al. rightly point out that no single study should be viewed as definitive, and that discovering robust findings takes time. But I think the authors miss an opportunity to talk about what specific practices accelerate the process of discovery and what practices retard it. Open sharing of results, positive and negative, data, experimental procedures, analysis code, and materials accelerates progress. In the fields of psychology, vision science, and neuroscience I am most familiar with, failures to replicate are almost impossible to publish. If the failures aren\u0026rsquo;t published, discovering the reasons for the failure will be difficult to discern. Open data, materials, analysis code, and procedure sharing are slowly growing in popularity, but still not commonplace. Without ready access to these elements, it is almost certain that attempts to replicate will differ from the original finding in ways that may or may not be readily apparent.\nRedish et al. state:\n A failure to reproduce is only the first step in scientific inquiry. In many ways, how science responds to these failures is what determines whether it succeeds.\n I agree. And the response of many open science advocates is to encourage our colleagues to adopt more transparent practices in reporting and sharing results, data, analyses, and materials, and to build tools for making this easy. If we want to build \u0026lsquo;a genuinely cumulative science\u0026rsquo;, to borrow a phrase from Walter Mischel, we need to attend to improving the processes of self-correction that Redish et al. rightly point out are endemic to science and essential to its power. Right now, it\u0026rsquo;s far too difficult for researchers to learn about failures to replicate or generalize and far too difficult to explore the reasons why. So perhaps the crisis of reproducibility is more usefully thought of as a crisis of transparency, and if this is so, there are ready solutions at hand.\n","date":1559606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559606400,"objectID":"73c922fc304bcab60e43f81f3fdb04cf","permalink":"/post/is-there-a-crisis-of-reproducibility-in-science/","publishdate":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/is-there-a-crisis-of-reproducibility-in-science/","section":"post","summary":"A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Redish et al. argues that \u0026lsquo;reproducibility failures are essential to scientific inquiry.\u0026rsquo; The authors remind readers that progress in many fields often proceeds haltingly, with successes, retrenchments, reconsiderations, and revisions.","tags":["reproducibility","open data"],"title":"Is there a crisis of reproducibility in science?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["politics","poetry"],"content":"we fear the people who love their guns more than we love our children.\nthe atheist prays every day to gods she finds incomprehensible:\nRemove the sticks of destruction from our arsenals and minds.

The fact remains, however, that despite our essential role in determining what data get collected from whom and how, we researchers have the weakest claim to actually owning the data we collect.\nIn the U.S., if my work is funded by a grant from the Federal government (e.g., NSF or NIH), then that award is actually made to my institution, not me. In fact, if I am unable to fulfill the obligations of the award, my institution may, and often will, appoint another person to do so. If my work is funded by another source, that source is likely to have implemented similar provisions. So, in reality, while researchers have a primary stewardship role over research data, it likely belongs to our institution.\nIn other contexts, the EU, for example, strong arguments have been made that research participants actually own their data. I am sympathetic to these arguments and believe that empowering individuals to grant researchers specific permission to use their data is the best path toward a future of ethical data use. Implementing that vision at-scale poses substantial challenges I believe academic researchers can eventually meet. The point of convergence is that researchers don\u0026rsquo;t own the data we collect.\nNot owning the data nevertheless means that we researchers must still think carefully about how best to protect it, our participants, and our institutions. As a practical matter, even though our institutions (or research participants) may own the data, we are the ones best positioned to determine what happens to those data when our project ends. In other words, the responsibility for determining the future life, if any, of our research data is one we can\u0026rsquo;t meaningfully shirk or easily ignore. At the same time, because the data aren\u0026rsquo;t really ours, considerations about any personal or career risk associated with sharing data can\u0026rsquo;t be at the center of the discussion. Instead, our obligations to research participants, our institutions, and funding agencies must take precedence. This means that fear of being scooped probably isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient justification to withhold sharing data.\nSharing data publicly without restriction is unnecessary and poses unforseen risks I believe that some of my colleagues who are skeptical about data sharing understand the practice to mean sharing data in publicly accessible ways. These skeptics argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t have permission to share data that way, and thus doing so would violate research ethics. I agree.\nIn fact, I go further. I am worried that we woefully underestimate the risks of participant reidentifiability associated with combining public and private data sets, even when research data have been stripped of conventional identifiers. Imagine if Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump had taken intro psych classes and the \u0026lsquo;deidentified\u0026rsquo; data were publicly available to anyone today. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it seem likely, certain even, that large well-funded teams of data scientists would be scouring the internet in order to try to expose Bernie\u0026rsquo;s answer to this survey question or Donald\u0026rsquo;s score on that cognitive test?\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t predict the future, but we can try to shape it.\nRather than make open, public sharing of data about human beings the expected norm, I suggest we build on an existing track-record of sharing these sorts data with restricted audiences. The Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research ( ICSPR) at the University of Michigan has been storing and sharing data with restricted audiences for almost 60 years. The U.S. Census has developed procedures for allowing restricted access to individual Census survey responses in highly secure and protected environments. The Databrary data library that I co-founded and co-direct has created a data library for openly sharing video and audio recordings with a restricted community of researchers. There are numerous examples of data sets shared by the U.S. government (e.g., NDAR) that have various restrictions on who can access data and for what purposes.\nThese examples illustrate that open data sharing need not be synonymous with public data sharing. The ICPSR and Census examples especially show that even the most sensitive data can be successfully shared with responsible researchers.\nYes, restricted sharing with researchers affiliated with institutions of higher learning or academic medical centers is \u0026lsquo;elitist\u0026rsquo; to some degree. But the checks and balances these institutions provide \u0026ndash; research ethics training, research review committees, research supervision, secure data storage infrastructure \u0026ndash; protect research participants in ways that public data sharing schemes simply cannot, at least not now. I think this form of elitism is justified in the name of protecting research participants. Or at the very least, that restricting data about human participants should be the norm unless and until we can be highly confident that public sharing truly poses minimal risk.\nThus, I conclude the following:\n Virtually all data about human research participants can be shared in some form. The standard for sharing data about human research participants should be to use a data repository that restricts access to specific individuals for purposes subject to external review. All researchers who collect data about human research participants should be collecting permission to share information from their participants so that any data sharing activities are in accord with participants\u0026rsquo; wishes. There are readily available templates researchers can adapt for seeking sharing permission. Going forward there is no reason for \u0026lsquo;failure to secure permission to share\u0026rsquo; to be a meaningful impediment.  Now, some may argue that the cost of securing permission to share and storing data in restricted repositories versus publicly accessible places must be weighed against the benefits. I don\u0026rsquo;t disagree that costs and benefits must be weighed, but it is often hard to weigh them objectively. Instead, I think it is safer to say that we have a longer history of and familiarity with restricted data sharing and more information about the costs of preparing data to share in these sorts of settings. So the surer bet in the long-term is to build on what has already been working. The risks of widespread public data sharing are a \u0026lsquo;known-unknown\u0026rsquo;, in Donald Rumsfeld\u0026rsquo;s categorical scheme, while the risks of restricted data sharing are \u0026lsquo;known-knowns\u0026rsquo;. I do not share Mr. Rumsfeld\u0026rsquo;s politics, but I find his thinking incisive and useful in this context.\nOne final point in favor of restricted sharing in centralized repositories is metadata standardization. If we view data sharing as an investment in future scholarship, then sharing data in standard ways that others can combine, reuse, and build upon is essential. By design (e.g., Databrary, government-sponsored data repositories) or long-standing practice (ICSPSR), data repositories provide standard metadata elements that make data more readily discoverable and reusable. Of course, curating data to meet these metadata standards takes time, but the payoff comes in accelerated resuse and discovery.\nSo, data about human participants should be shared (with permission) in data repositories that restrict access and support standardized metadata, and all of us who do research with human participants should be seeking explicit permission to share in these ways.\nSharing data, materials, and analysis scripts is more important to open science than pre-registration I greatly admire the efforts of the team at the Center for Open Science in bringing preregistration and registered reports into widespread scientific discussion and making them a much more common practice. There is no question that drawing clearer, brighter lines between confirmatory and exploratory analyses improves the quality of scientific inference and mitigates questionable research practices.\nThat said, I get the biggest and hardest push-back from colleagues about preregistration when discussing open science practices. One reason is that many people find the process of pregistration difficult, frustrating, and onerous. Yes, there are lots of templates to choose from, and yes, many of the details are already in our IRB protocols or grant proposals. But even so, the benefits of pre-registration seem small relative to the high costs, especially to skeptics.\nFor these reasons, and innate pragmatism, I spend more of my energy talking-up data sharing. Data are more interesting to me personally and probably more useful in evaluating the impact and importance of a given piece of work than a detailed preregistration plan. One of my graduate school mentors told me that he reads a paper\u0026rsquo;s methods and results first, and only after that decides whether to read the introduction and conclusion. Frankly, if the data aren\u0026rsquo;t interesting or the effects clear, I don\u0026rsquo;t care that much what the authors predicted or how they tortured the data. And by extension, if the effect is strong, it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to matter much whether the authors predicted it or not. Further, I\u0026rsquo;ve found no convincing retort to the skeptics who ask me why I think someone actually followed their preregistered procedure. In short, I think that most studies on human participants are under-powered and that we need to vastly increase the quantity of shared data in order to address problems of estimating true effect size distributions. While I may not really know whether a researcher followed the protocol reported in a manuscript or in their preregistration, I can evaluate the size of the reported effect and hopefully combine it with other datasets\u0026hellip;if the data are shared. When push comes to shove, I\u0026rsquo;d rather authors commit to open data sharing and carry through on their commitments than encourage people to preregister but have them stop short of sharing.\nSo, while I\u0026rsquo;m completely happy endorsing the virtues of preregistration, I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep asking authors of papers I review, most of which are not preregistered, to share their data. That\u0026rsquo;s because I think data, materials, and analysis code sharing is ultimately more important to advancing discovery than preregistration. And \u0026lsquo;learn more faster\u0026rsquo; is not only Databrary\u0026rsquo;s tagline, is my personal motivation for adopting open science practices. That ultimate goal can get lost in the sometimes devilish discussions about specific details.\n","date":1556064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556064000,"objectID":"3dcb249f4122f6115f4d0ab3d42d38e6","permalink":"/post/devilish-details/","publishdate":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/devilish-details/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself at odds recently with colleagues who, like me, view themselves as advocates for open science.

The following is a draft response my colleagues and I are working on.\n Dear Dr. Bianchi:\nThank you for the opportunity to respond to the NICHD Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020-2024. We write as Principal Investigators of the Play \u0026amp; Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project (R01HD094830), a 65-researcher-strong video-based study of natural infant/mother behavior, funded by NICHD, NIMH, OBSSSR, and the Office of the Director. Our recommendation is simple: We urge you and your colleagues to incorporate a clear vision for behavioral research in the plan\u0026rsquo;s research themes and goals to underscore the pivotal importance of behavior and experience in child development.\nBehavior is the linchpin of the most vexing problems in public health, and a better understanding of behavior is fundamental to achieving positive health outcomes, from prenatal development throughout adulthood. Behavior contributes to the progression or prevention of disease, defines a disorder or marks recovery, and provides mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. The study of child health and human development magnifies this importance. According to the CDC, two of the three leading causes of death among children aged 1-4 (accidents and assault/homicide) and children aged 5- 14 (accidents and suicide) involve behavior, among other factors. One child in six has a developmental disability. The most common developmental disabilities—autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sensory impairments—substantially impact behaviors across the lifespan, and often the most effective interventions are behavioral. Virtually every problem in children, families, and society—substance use, school violence, school dropout, ethnic disparities, emotional dysregulation, racism and discrimination, and more—can be traced to behaviors and experiences in childhood. Moreover, the growing field of epigenetics reveals that genetics data alone provide limited insights about developmental outcomes without critical information about early experiences, behaviors, and environments.\nIn the context of the NICHD 2020-2024 Strategic plan, our specific recommendations are as follows. In Research Theme #1—understanding early human development—we ask that you expand the focus beyond genetic and cellular levels of analysis and incorporate maternal and fetal behavior as central phenomena that need to be studied and understood. Similarly, regarding Research Theme #2—setting the stage for a healthy pregnancy—we ask that you expand the focus to include maternal and other caregiver behaviors, including paternal behaviors, that may reduce or elevate risk. Research Theme #4—identifying sensitive time periods to optimize health interventions—highlights the role of behavior. However, the plan implies that we have sufficient knowledge about the varied trajectories of typical development to productively intervene in atypical development. This may be true in a limited set of domains, but is not broadly true in our experience. Much more research about behavioral development is needed. Our suggestion about Research Theme #5—Improving health during the transition from adolescence to adulthood—is to broaden the lens to include research on childhood behaviors observed in a variety of settings that serve as precursors to risk in adolescence.\nWe wish to emphasize that many standardized laboratory tasks or parent-report questionnaire instruments thought to reliably reflect the \u0026ldquo;phenotype,\u0026rdquo; fail to capture vital dimensions of infant, child, adolescent, and parent behavior that occur in natural settings. Indeed, this gap motivates our focus on video in the PLAY project. Natural behavior in home, school, and clinical settings can be reliably and informatively captured and analyzed using video. And we have shown that video can be securely and ethically shared using tools for video informatics (Databrary and Datavyu) and policies for restricted data sharing with explicit consent that we have developed and shared with the research community thanks to NICHD support (U01HD076595).\nThe PLAY project capitalizes on these advances in an effort to capture, analyze, and openly share data about the building blocks of infant and maternal behavior combining video with other data sources. PLAY is motivated in part by the belief that the hard-won knowledge gleaned from public funding for the genome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome initiatives will have substantially greater impact on child and maternal health outcomes when combined with insights from a corresponding \u0026ldquo;behaviorome.\u0026rdquo; As a \u0026ldquo;behaviorome\u0026rdquo;-like research effort, PLAY aims to accelerate the pace of discovery in basic and applied developmental science. NICHD has a strong track record of funding research on infant and child behavior. Given the essential role of behavior in maternal, child, and adolescent health, we urge NICHD to build upon this tradition by giving the study of behavior substantially greater emphasis and visibility in the 2020-2024 strategic plan and beyond.\nYours truly,\nKaren Adolph, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, New York University\nRick O.

Mental experience \u0026ndash; thoughts and feelings \u0026ndash; are also common targets of inquiry.\nI recently went looking for a systematic catalogue of behaviors that should, in theory, constitute the substance of what psychologists and other behavioral scientists study. My goal was to take that catalogue as a starting point for thinking about the relationship between information available for perception and the actions (behaviors) that this information informs. The formal term for this sort of catalog is an \u0026lsquo; ethogram'. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sample template from the Tree of Life project. Unfortunately, I failed in my quest.\nThere have been attempts to create and openly share animal ethograms like the apparently stalled or inactive ethobank.org site associated with the EthoSource project. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology and the Cognitive Atlas project attempt to create systematic ontologies (systematic representations of categories and concepts and their relations) of tasks used in experimental psychology. Cognitive psychology tasks clearly require very specific types of behavior from participants. Systematically organizing the nature of these tasks should lead to faster progress in understanding how they relate to one another, and ultimately, how minds and brains actually work. Still, I came up short in finding a comprehensive human ethogram.\nIn other contexts, I\u0026rsquo;ve called such a thing the behaviorome, partly to suggest that behavior should have a more central place in research grantmaking priorities. The PLAY project is a type of behaviorome effort. We will be creating detailed definitions for specific behaviors that our infant and adult participants produce in a small set of behavioral domains, but it will not be comprehensive by any means. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m stuck with trying to assemble my own.\nOne approach to an ethogram for humans could focus on biologically essential behavioral classes that we share with all other animals: ingestion (food and nutrient seeking), defense (self-protection), and reproduction. Unfortunately, this scheme fail to capture the sets of behaviors studied by the majority of psychologists. Adding in a class of communicative and affiliative behaviors helps. But even this augmented classification describes the functional purposes of behavior, not the behaviors themselves. For example, locomotor behavior, moving toward or away from some target, occurs in food seeking, predator avoidance, mate seeking, and social (affiliative) contexts.\nAnother way to ask the question is to observe whether physical activities that humans do for pleasure and watch others for entertainment (sports) have some latent structure we might exploit. Here, we assume that if large groups of humans engage in an activity or pay to watch others engage in it, the skills involved must be especially demanding. Indeed, professional sports represent some of humankind\u0026rsquo;s most skilled (and highly paid) actors. And while I\u0026rsquo;m still looking for a comprehensive catalog of sport types, this table shows that most of them fall into a small set of categories when focusing on the core actions that define success.\n   Category Sports     aiming basketball, baseball, football (passing \u0026amp; kicking), hocky, soccer, bowling, tennis, golf, pool/billiards, archery, \u0026hellip;   steering slalom skiing, motorsports   performing gymnastics, diving, synchronized swimming, figure skating, \u0026hellip;   racing running, motorsports, speed skating, swimming, cycling, paddling   fighting boxing, wrestling, \u0026hellip;   feats of strength weightlifting    You may disagree with my categorization, but I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll agree that there are many similarities in the sorts of actions we find entertaining to watch.\nAnother approach to an ethogram starts with the actions that computer vision researchers find are important to extract from video. Google’s Atomic Visual Action (AVA) dataset (https://research.google.com/ava/) involves three classes of movements, person movement, object interaction, person interaction, and has exemplars with 81 specific actions that fit into these categories. Some examples of specific behaviors tagged in the AVA dataset are crawl, dance, jump/leap, lift, open, press, hug, kiss, and listen to.\nMaybe some combination of these approaches is as good a start as any. After all, if behavioral biologists don\u0026rsquo;t seem to agree about what constitutes behavior, it\u0026rsquo;s not that surprising that psychologists haven\u0026rsquo;t yet created our own list. We do need a list like this, though, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\n","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"58942c33dbdf4bd52c14fb0f3af82897","permalink":"/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/","section":"post","summary":"Psychology is in part, a science of behavior.

In short, there are a handful of perception/action systems that provide the nervous system with deterministic, causal information about the effects of different actions. These must be important for development.\nFor the next step, I’m looking for a concise, but thorough parameterization of body posture that includes the eyes, head, torso, arms, and legs.

Now, if the visual signals from eye vs. head vs. torso can be distinguished, then these could couple with other proprioceptive (muscle, tendon, cutaneous) signals to provide a powerful set of sensory signals that are directly caused by eye, head, and torso motion. See this earlier post for a causal graph that elaborates on this point. I’ll discuss why I think there are visual differences in the effects of eye and head motion in a future post.\nMy next step is to ask my colleagues in kinesiology if there is a canonical parameterization of body position that I can build upon.

Eye movements stem from eye movement commands; head movements (translations and rotations) stem from head movement commands; body movements stem from commands to move the body. Movements of the eyes, head, or body generate proprioceptive signals from the eyes, head, and body. These signals derive from muscle, joint, and tendon receptors. Rotational and translational motion of the head stimulates vestibular signals.\nNote that retinal motion caused by the observer has multiple non-visual correlates (or consequences) that are detectable under typical circumstances. There may also be differences in the specific properties of motion caused by eye, head, body, or object motion.

The world, body, and brain are directly measurable in various ways. The mind is not. We infer properties and structures of the mind indirectly, through patterns of brain activity or peripheral physiology or behavior. The focal point of psychology as a science is making inferences about something that cannot be directly measured. This is one reason psychology is harder than physics.\nThe figure has other associations. It is similar to one used to demonstrate that rotational motion in 2 dimensions can evoke the perception of an object in 3 dimensions \u0026ndash; something called the stereokinetic depth effect (SKE). It evokes the perception of a cone-like shape protruding up and to the left. And it evokes a weaker perception of a tunnel.

Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience. But my R package development skills are entirely self-taught. I must thank the incredibly generous geniuses who have gone before me and who share their code and their talents so freely and openly. Without the almost instant availability of these resources, my progress would be much, much slower.\nDevelopers are an opinionated bunch, and there are at least as many styles (fads?) in software development as their are developers. One style that I have started to try to emulate is ‘test-driven development’. In TDD, the idea is that you create tests for how each part of your package should respond given this or that input. If your tests are through enough and correct, your package should work…at least within the boundaries of what you tested.\nFor the latest version of the package (0.1.4), I added a bunch of new tests to evaluate several new functions I’ve added to the package. Let’s just say that getting through my own self-designed test battery was challenging. But as a result, the code is cleaner and less buggy than it would be if I hadn’t gone this route.\nIn the larger sense, TDD is sort of a “plan for the worst” style. I like it because I know it forces me to be more precise and specific than I might otherwise choose to be. Since I’ve been using the databraryapi more often for keeping tabs on what’s going on in the Databrary world, that’s a very good thing.\nIn case you’re curious what the package can do, check this out:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi\u0026quot;) ## Skipping install of \u0026#39;databraryapi\u0026#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (a6a700ea) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation Here is a list of some recently authorized researchers:\ndatabraryapi::get_db_stats(\u0026quot;people\u0026quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## id sortname prename affiliation url institution ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; ## 1 4744 Tadepalli Prasad Oregon State University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 2 4871 Black Jessica Jan Saint Vincent College \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 3 4477 Prull Matthew Whitman College \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 4 753 Childers Jane Trinity University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 5 4881 Lindskog Marcus Uppsala University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA ## 6 4852 Hudson Danae Missouri State University \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; NA And here is a very simple plot of the growth in authorized researchers and institutions over time:\nwith(databraryapi::read_csv_data_as_df(), plot(Auth_Investigators, Institutions)) ## No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.

Many of these solutions were devised by the Databrary.org data library for storing and sharing video, audio, and other forms of sensitive or personally identifiable data. We also discuss ways in which researchers can make shared data and materials easier for others to find and reuse.
