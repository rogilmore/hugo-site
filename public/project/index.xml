      <description>The Play &amp;amp; Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project will provide a first-ever glimpse inside the homes of almost 1,000 families across the U.S. We will collect, annotate (code), and openly share on Databrary video recordings of mothers and 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old infants engaged in natural behavior in their homes.</description>

      <description>Video recordings pose challenges for data sharing. They contain faces and voices that cannot be easily eliminated or altered without harming the value of the recordings for other researchers. My colleagues and I developed a data sharing policy framework for Databrary that requires researchers to gain consent to share from research participants and restricts access to institutionally-approved researchers. Databrary&amp;rsquo;s template sharing release (permission) language may be found here, and some draft language relevant for gaining permission to share identifiable in the context of the EU&amp;rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may be found here.</description>
