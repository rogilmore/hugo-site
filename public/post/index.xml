      <title>This is great</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps like me you suspected that the red hats did not share your view of what makes America great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERIbhsCzZwk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know the depth of that disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the methodical and patriotic work of the House impeachment managers, we know in terrifying detail how much worse 1/6 might have become. Already there were casualties, among mobsters and law enforcement alike, shot, bludgeoned, or crushed to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue lives matter, except of course when they do not. Especially when their loss does not fit an expedient narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbukVhEih58&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unconscionable acts of aggression against the foundations of our democracy by leaders and citizens alike are great only to tyrants and knaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frum has observed that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/there-is-no-defenseonly-complicity/617996/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;complicity&lt;/a&gt; or conviction are the only choices for senators terrified of the beast their cowardice has created. Will worries that only 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/will-senate-republicans-allow-their-louts-to-rule-the-party/2021/02/11/ce082db6-6caf-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;louts&lt;/a&gt; will remain in a party perhaps once grand but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry that senators will soon choose what vision of greatness they endorse and not enough will choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This is personal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign is suing Centre County where I live and serve as an election official:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.centredaily.com/news/politics-government/election/article247090102.html?ac_cid=DM321193&amp;amp;ac_bid=-1472755416&#34;&gt;https://www.centredaily.com/news/politics-government/election/article247090102.html?ac_cid=DM321193&amp;amp;ac_bid=-1472755416&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In State College East 3 Precinct 26, we have a longstanding tradition of helping every single voter, regardless of party affiliation.
Our neighborhood has permanent residents and more transient ones, usually Penn State students.
So, many of the voters who show up on election day, especially in a presidential election year, do so for the first time.
Some of them come to our precinct because that&amp;rsquo;s the one in their neighborhood even though they might be registered in another precinct.
If they aren&amp;rsquo;t registered in our precinct, we help them find out if they are registered and where they are registered.
That&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to do, but we know which websites to have them check and how to advise them about their options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 states offer same day voting and registration.
Pennsylvania is not one of them.
We do our best with the system we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we had a small number of students show up who weren&amp;rsquo;t registered in Pennsylvania at all.
We advised them they could only vote a provisional ballot and that it was extremely unlikely that their vote would ultimately be counted.
Most chose to vote anyway, just in case there was a chance that their vote might count.
So, we helped these voters cast a provisional ballot, putting the decision about which ballots would ultimately be counted in the final in the hands of our county&amp;rsquo;s election board.
Most importantly, we did not stand in the way of any voter casting a ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do these things in our precinct because we believe that every voter counts even if every single vote does not.
We do these things because many of us are educators, and we believe that encouraging habits of civic engagement are part of the legacy we want to leave.
We do these things because we believe that our union is stronger when more people participate in decisions about who should lead.
We do this because powerful forces throughout the history of our country have tried to restrict access to the ballot box and those forces are still active today.
We do these things because we believe that the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is more important than the &lt;em&gt;outcome&lt;/em&gt;.
We do these things because they reflect what the Founders meant when they described their motivations for establishing the Constitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our union is far from perfect, justice is not always done, and we are far from tranquil.
But the actions by Mr. Trump and his supporters to undermine the integrity of the election&amp;ndash;before it had occurred and in its aftermath&amp;ndash;are deeply and profoundly wrong.
To allege voting fraud without any actual evidence undermines the common defense, erodes the general welfare, and threatens the blessings of liberty.
And for election officials like me who work hard to ensure a fair and just voting process for everyone, the allegations are more than a little personal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This, I believe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that Earth is the only planet our species can expect to thrive on for the imaginable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that human activities are threatening our planet&amp;rsquo;s viabilility as a home for us and for other forms of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that human ingenuity can devise ways for us to reduce or eliminate those threats and enable us to continue to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that doing so requires those of us in the wealthiest countries to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that we must make greater sacrifices than others, we must show resolve and discipline, and we must lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that Americans have the courage to lead and the strength to make these sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that a small, powerful, and vocal minority of Americans and allied foreign interests undermine that courage and diminish that strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that many people are terrified of the future and mask their terror in anger and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that others think their considerable wealth can protect them from an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that these people personally benefit from undermining American unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the fearful and angry command our attention and sap our energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the self-serving and cynical provide no path to a better tomorrow for anyone but themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that America can be great only if it can admit where and when and why it is not; Only then can we mend what is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that without courage there is no honesty; without honesty, there is no truth; without truth, there is no justice; without justice, there is no peace; and without peace, there is no promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Home of the meek</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the corona virus pandemic provides the entire world a terrifying reminder that human life and civilization is vulnerable to the whims of uncaring forces of nature.
There is also no doubt that some countries, or more precisely, some cultures appear much better equipped than others to confront the challenges of the current moment.
Significant parts of American culture are not among the well-equipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe, for example, the case of Nebraska, where meatpacking plants have had significant corona virus outbreaks, but companies and public officials have been reluctant to provide information about the extent of the problem (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/12/nebraska-coronavirus-case-numbers-meatpacking/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_most&#34;&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/12/nebraska-coronavirus-case-numbers-meatpacking/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_most&lt;/a&gt;) until pressured to do so by the fear of embarrassment.
Can we agree in this bitterly divided nation that all of us are afraid of the very same things &amp;ndash; that the virus might harm us or those we care about and that a prolonged quarantine might destroy a way of life we have come to enjoy?
I submit to you that until those parts of American culture that vigorously deny their fear can face it squarely &amp;ndash; rather than mask it with anger and bravado &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to provide the world  object lessons in how not to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facts, data, evidence, reason, discipline, skepticism, sacrifice, generosity, honor, resolve, and courage.
These are what we need now, from everyone everywhere.
Make Americans brave again.
Please.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Morse, of course</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a ham for only a few years.
In that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed sampling the hobby&amp;rsquo;s many facets.
When I first heard about ham radio as a boy, the thrills were mostly about talking by voice and CW (Morse code) to stations around the world.
Now there are dozens of digital (computer-to-computer) modes, styles of operating, and bands to operate on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a bit of Morse code back when I was first licensed in 1993.
But in my second reincarnation as a ham, the code requirements had been dropped, and so there was no compelling reason to learn it.
Except that I wanted to.
For reasons I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to learn skills that don&amp;rsquo;t have much practical use but have a venerable history and still attract enthusiasts.
Playing clawhammer banjo is one, and learning to operate CW (the transmission mode that turns Morse code into radio waves) is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after starting one of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cwops.org/cw-academy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CW Academy&lt;/a&gt; courses in January 2019, I tried again this year.
I took the Beginner class earlier this year, and I&amp;rsquo;m now 2/3 of the way through the Basic class.
The instructors are fantastic.
The curriculum is well-structured and useful.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress.
But, boy is it hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, any number of new things came to me rather easily.
Not everything, but many things.
And I grew accustomed to thinking I was a fast learner.
Welcome to middle age.
As with learning the banjo, or learning lines or music for a theatrical production, I find that I have to work much, much harder than I did when I was younger.
Or alternatively, I have to adjust my expectations about how much progress I&amp;rsquo;ll see with the amount of work I put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also humbling, but gratifying to be on the other side of the teaching lectern.
I think all professors should find ways to be students, again.
Puts things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m sure that when all the dits and dahs finally sound like words to my brain&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re starting to, every now and then&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ll be glad I stayed the course.
There&amp;rsquo;s something magical about reaching out to another person and talking with them over the airwaves, and especially when it&amp;rsquo;s in a &amp;lsquo;language&amp;rsquo; that started the age of radio communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seeing through the fog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I understand why Republican partisans want to confuse the public.
But this is crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No candidate for elected office in the United States should &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; seek or receive help from foreign countries to win an election.
Not ever.
Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In taking office, a president pledges (or affirms) to &amp;ldquo;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.&amp;rdquo;
Senators and Congressional Representatives pledge (or affirm) to &amp;ldquo;support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has now at least twice asked for help from a foreign power to gain political advantage over an opponent, once as a candidate, and at least once as president.
The asking itself is unmistakably, incontrovertibly, and indefensibly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking foreign interference subverts the integrity of our elections, undermines the Constitution, and violates the presidential oath of office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A president must uphold the rule of law not advance the law of rulers.
He is unfit.
He must be impeached and removed from office.
Failing to do so represents a violation of the oath of office taken by Senators and Representatives alike to &amp;ldquo;defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no fog here, just strategically and cynically blown smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What makes America great (to me)</title>
      <link>/post/what-makes-america-great-to-me/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/what-makes-america-great-to-me/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I rode my bicycle to our public library (an American innovation), and walked around the corner to an Indian restaurant that is owned and operated by people of Latin American heritage.
While I enjoyed a quiet lunch, diners of all ages and multiple backgrounds did the same.
There was a head-scarf-wearing mother who works at the restaurant attending to her infant, a separate group of head-scarf-wearing people, people in wheelchairs, people with long hair and short, dark skin and light.
This panorama of humanity found common purpose in our peaceful enjoyment of food from one of the world&amp;rsquo;s great civilizations.
And we like to joke that State College is &amp;ldquo;centrally isolated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes America great (to me) is exactly, precisely this diversity.
What makes America great is that from our very founding, we have attempted to forge a one from the many.
Did you know that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;E Pluribus Unum&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;out of many, one&amp;rdquo;, was considered our de facto motto until the 1950&amp;rsquo;s when &amp;ldquo;In God We Trust&amp;rdquo; was adopted as the official one?
I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
And I think that was a mistake, just as I think adding 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;under God&amp;rdquo; to the Pledge of Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; was a mistake.
Atheists and animists comprise the pluribus, too.
And somehow I suspect a supreme entity, should one exist, is diminished in no way by a national motto or pledge that fully reflects the diversity of the creation, encompassing believer and unbeliever alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so what makes America great (to me) is this very struggle.
Are we one Nation of many, including diverse and discrepant views on religious questions, racial and ethnic backgrounds, languages and cultures, or are we something else, something, well, smaller?
I know that loud voices in our land today and among our leaders want to expel the different and shun the diverse, to make us smaller, more homogeneous.
And what makes America great (to me) is that these too often hateful and fearful voices also have their place among the threads of the national tapestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But love it or not, a patchwork, quilt-like tapestry it is, &lt;em&gt;we are&lt;/em&gt;, first, foremost, and finally.
And that, my friends, is a flag that genuine patriots are most happy to wrap themselves in.
Like a burrito.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just do it!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I participated in my first Field Day as a ham.
For the uninitiated, Field Day is an annual event where radio amateurs set-up radio stations in locations they would normally not operate.
We then try to make as many contacts as possible in a 24 hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My local club, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nittany-arc.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nittany Amateur Radio Club&lt;/a&gt; brings out the big guns for Field Day &amp;ndash; big directional beam antennas, high power amplifiers, and capable radios (Elecraft K3S and Icom IC-7610).
This year was no exception.
Here are a few pics I took early Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/6m-moon.jpg&#34; width=300px/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/vhf-uhf.jpg&#34; width=300px/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../../yagis-fd-2019.jpg&#34; height=480px/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike two years ago, when one of the more senior hams had to shove the microphone and headphones into my hands to get me to jump into the chair, this year I happily jumped into the fray whenever the opportunity arose.
And that would include 3 am on Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in seeing an experienced ham work a pile-up and think how could I possibly listen, type, and talk in the phonetic alphabet without losing it.
And the answer is, like so many other things, you just have to try.
So, my unsolicited advice to hams like me who are a little mic shy, or maybe intimidated by CW?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just do it.
It&amp;rsquo;s exhilarating to jump out of your comfort zone and piles of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, some afternoons you can &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; (talk to) people in Greenland with 100 Watts and a wire strung up between the trees in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73 de K3ROG&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is there a crisis of reproducibility in science?</title>
      <link>/post/is-there-a-crisis-of-reproducibility-in-science/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/is-there-a-crisis-of-reproducibility-in-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1806370115&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; by Redish et al. argues that &amp;lsquo;reproducibility failures are essential to scientific inquiry.&amp;rsquo;
The authors remind readers that progress in many fields often proceeds haltingly, with successes, retrenchments, reconsiderations, and revisions.
As examples, Redish et al. summarize the history of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Four Color Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, the claim that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fourier series&lt;/a&gt; can characterize any function, and the conditions under which neural networks can carry out certain computations.
I find useful these reminders from mathematics and computer science that progress and regress are essential parts of the trajectory of scientific discovery, but I find unconvincing arguments that &amp;lsquo;many of the current concerns about reproducibility overlook the dynamic, iterative nature of the process of discovery.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2016 survey in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, some 90% of scientists surveyed agreed that &amp;lsquo;there is a reproducibility crisis.&amp;rsquo;
Sixty to eighty percent of scientists in fields from chemistry to earth and environmental sciences reported failing to reproduce someone else&amp;rsquo;s experiment, and 40-60% reported failing to reproduce their own experiments.
Respondents expressed widely-ranging opinions about &amp;lsquo;how much published work in your field is reproducible?&amp;rsquo;
Curiously, physicists and chemists were most confident in the literature AND most likely to report having failed to reproduce a study.
Perhaps chemists and physicists are more likely to attempt to reproduce published results than scientists in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redish et al. rightly point out that no single study should be viewed as definitive, and that discovering robust findings takes time.
But I think the authors miss an opportunity to talk about what specific practices accelerate the process of discovery and what practices retard it.
Open sharing of results, positive and negative, data, experimental procedures, analysis code, and materials accelerates progress.
In the fields of psychology, vision science, and neuroscience I am most familiar with, failures to replicate are almost impossible to publish.
If the failures aren&amp;rsquo;t published, discovering the reasons for the failure will be difficult to discern.
Open data, materials, analysis code, and procedure sharing are slowly growing in popularity, but still not commonplace.
Without ready access to these elements, it is almost certain that attempts to replicate will differ from the original finding in ways that may or may not be readily apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redish et al. state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A failure to reproduce is only the first step in scientific inquiry. In many ways, how science responds to these failures is what determines whether it succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree.
And the response of many open science advocates is to encourage our colleagues to adopt more transparent practices in reporting and sharing results, data, analyses, and materials, and to build 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://databrary.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; for making this easy.
If we want to build &amp;lsquo;a genuinely cumulative science&amp;rsquo;, to borrow a phrase from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Walter Mischel&lt;/a&gt;, we need to attend to improving the processes of self-correction that Redish et al. rightly point out are endemic to science and essential to its power.
Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s far too difficult for researchers to learn about failures to replicate or generalize and far too difficult to explore the reasons why.
So perhaps the crisis of reproducibility is more usefully thought of as a crisis of transparency, and if this is so, there are ready solutions at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we fear the people who love their guns&lt;/br&gt;
more than we love our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the atheist prays every day to gods she finds incomprehensible:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the sticks of destruction&lt;/br&gt;
from our arsenals and minds.&lt;/br&gt;
Banish them to eternity.&lt;/br&gt;
Cleanse us that we may be clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a merciful god would hear this supplicant,&lt;/br&gt;
know her grace, &lt;/br&gt;
and answer in the affirmative.&lt;/br&gt;
a god who loved his children&lt;/br&gt;
would, she thinks and hopes.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we could surely find other ways of killing, you object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes, I acknowledge,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or perhaps&lt;/br&gt;
just perhaps&lt;/br&gt;
choose not to.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Devilish details</title>
      <link>/post/devilish-details/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/devilish-details/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself at odds recently with colleagues who, like me, view themselves as advocates for open science.
This post attempts to clarify what I see as the crux of our disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-dont-own-our-data&#34;&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t own our data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most researchers feel a strong sense of ownership about our data and often, properly so I think, feel especially protective of our research participants.
The fact remains, however, that despite our essential role in determining what data get collected from whom and how, we researchers have the weakest claim to actually &lt;em&gt;owning&lt;/em&gt; the data we collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., if my work is funded by a grant from the Federal government (e.g., NSF or NIH), then that award is actually made to &lt;em&gt;my institution&lt;/em&gt;, not me.
In fact, if I am unable to fulfill the obligations of the award, my institution may, and often will, appoint another person to do so.
If my work is funded by another source, that source is likely to have implemented similar provisions.
So, in reality, while researchers have a primary stewardship role over research data, it likely belongs to our institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other contexts, the EU, for example, strong arguments have been made that &lt;em&gt;research participants&lt;/em&gt; actually own their data.
I am sympathetic to these arguments and believe that empowering individuals to grant researchers specific permission to use their data is the best path toward a future of ethical data use.
Implementing that vision at-scale poses substantial challenges I believe academic researchers can eventually meet.
The point of convergence is that researchers don&amp;rsquo;t own the data we collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not owning the data nevertheless means that we researchers must still think carefully about how best to protect it, our participants, and our institutions.
As a practical matter, even though our institutions (or research participants) may own the data, we are the ones best positioned to determine what happens to those data when our project ends.
In other words, the responsibility for determining the future life, if any, of our research data is one we can&amp;rsquo;t meaningfully shirk or easily ignore.
At the same time, because the data aren&amp;rsquo;t really ours,  considerations about any personal or career risk associated with sharing data can&amp;rsquo;t be at the center of the discussion.
Instead, our obligations to research participants, our institutions, and funding agencies must take precedence.
This means that fear of being scooped probably isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient justification to withhold sharing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-data-publicly-without-restriction-is-unnecessary-and-poses-unforseen-risks&#34;&gt;Sharing data publicly without restriction is unnecessary and poses unforseen risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that some of my colleagues who are skeptical about data sharing understand the practice to mean sharing data in publicly accessible ways.
These skeptics argue that they don&amp;rsquo;t have permission to share data that way, and thus doing so would violate research ethics.
I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I go further.
I am worried that we woefully underestimate the risks of participant reidentifiability associated with combining public and private data sets, even when research data have been stripped of conventional identifiers.
Imagine if Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump had taken intro psych classes and the &amp;lsquo;deidentified&amp;rsquo; data were publicly available to anyone today.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it seem likely, certain even, that large well-funded teams of data scientists would be scouring the internet in order to try to expose Bernie&amp;rsquo;s answer to this survey question or Donald&amp;rsquo;s score on that cognitive test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t predict the future, but we can try to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than make open, public sharing of data about human beings the expected norm, I suggest we build on an existing track-record of sharing these sorts data with restricted audiences.
The Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://icpsr.umich.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ICSPR&lt;/a&gt;) at the University of Michigan has been storing and sharing data with restricted audiences for almost 60 years.
The U.S. Census has developed procedures for allowing restricted access to individual Census survey responses in highly secure and protected environments.
The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://databrary.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Databrary&lt;/a&gt; data library that I co-founded and co-direct has created a data library for openly sharing video and audio recordings with a restricted community of researchers.
There are numerous examples of data sets shared by the U.S. government (e.g., NDAR) that have various restrictions on who can access data and for what purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples illustrate that open data sharing need not be synonymous with public data sharing.
The ICPSR and Census examples especially show that even the most sensitive data can be successfully shared with responsible researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, restricted sharing with researchers affiliated with institutions of higher learning or academic medical centers is &amp;lsquo;elitist&amp;rsquo; to some degree.
But the checks and balances these institutions provide &amp;ndash; research ethics training, research review committees, research supervision, secure data storage infrastructure &amp;ndash; protect research participants in ways that public data sharing schemes simply cannot, at least not now.
I think this form of elitism is justified in the name of protecting research participants.
Or at the very least, that restricting data about human participants should be the norm unless and until we can be highly confident that public sharing truly poses minimal risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I conclude the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually all data about human research participants can be shared in some form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard for sharing data about human research participants should be to use a data repository that restricts access to specific individuals for purposes subject to external review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All researchers who collect data about human research participants should be collecting permission to share information from their participants so that any data sharing activities are in accord with participants&amp;rsquo; wishes. There are readily available 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.databrary.org/resources/templates.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; researchers can adapt for seeking sharing permission. Going forward there is no reason for &amp;lsquo;failure to secure permission to share&amp;rsquo; to be a meaningful impediment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some may argue that the cost of securing permission to share and storing data in restricted repositories versus publicly accessible places must be weighed against the benefits.
I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree that costs and benefits must be weighed, but it is often hard to weigh them objectively.
Instead, I think it is safer to say that we have a longer history of and familiarity with restricted data sharing and more information about the costs of preparing data to share in these sorts of settings.
So the surer bet in the long-term is to build on what has already been working.
The risks of widespread public data sharing are a &amp;lsquo;known-unknown&amp;rsquo;, in Donald Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s categorical scheme, while the risks of restricted data sharing are &amp;lsquo;known-knowns&amp;rsquo;.
I do not share Mr. Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s politics, but I find his thinking incisive and useful  in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final point in favor of restricted sharing in centralized repositories is metadata standardization.
If we view data sharing as an investment in future scholarship, then sharing data in standard ways that others can combine, reuse, and build upon is essential.
By design (e.g., Databrary, government-sponsored data repositories) or long-standing practice (ICSPSR), data repositories provide standard metadata elements that make data more readily discoverable and reusable.
Of course, curating data to meet these metadata standards takes time, but the payoff comes in accelerated resuse and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, data about human participants should be shared (with permission) in data repositories that restrict access and support standardized metadata, and all of us who do research with human participants should be seeking explicit permission to share in these ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-data-materials-and-analysis-scripts-is-more-important-to-open-science-than-pre-registration&#34;&gt;Sharing data, materials, and analysis scripts is more important to open science than pre-registration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly admire the efforts of the team at the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cos.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt; in bringing preregistration and registered reports into widespread scientific discussion and making them a much more common practice.
There is no question that drawing clearer, brighter lines between confirmatory and exploratory analyses improves the quality of scientific inference and mitigates questionable research practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I get the biggest and hardest push-back from colleagues about preregistration when discussing open science practices.
One reason is that many people find the process of pregistration difficult, frustrating, and onerous.
Yes, there are lots of templates to choose from, and yes, many of the details are already in our IRB protocols or grant proposals.
But even so, the benefits of pre-registration seem small relative to the high costs, especially to skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, and innate pragmatism, I spend more of my energy talking-up data sharing.
Data are more interesting to me personally and probably more useful in evaluating the impact and importance of a given piece of work than a detailed preregistration plan.
One of my graduate school mentors told me that he reads a paper&amp;rsquo;s methods and results first, and only after that decides whether to read the introduction and conclusion.
Frankly, if the data aren&amp;rsquo;t interesting or the effects clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t care that much what the authors predicted or how they tortured the data.
And by extension, if the effect is strong, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to matter much whether the authors predicted it or not.
Further, I&amp;rsquo;ve found no convincing retort to the skeptics who ask me why I think someone actually followed their preregistered procedure.
In short, I think that most studies on human participants are under-powered and that we need to vastly increase the quantity of shared data in order to address problems of estimating true effect size distributions.
While I may not really know whether a researcher followed the protocol reported in a manuscript or in their preregistration, I can evaluate the size of the reported effect and hopefully combine it with other datasets&amp;hellip;if the data are shared.
When push comes to shove, I&amp;rsquo;d rather authors commit to open data sharing and carry through on their commitments than encourage people to preregister but have them stop short of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I&amp;rsquo;m completely happy endorsing the virtues of preregistration, I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep asking authors of papers I review, most of which are not preregistered, to share their data.
That&amp;rsquo;s because I think data, materials, and analysis code sharing is ultimately more important to advancing discovery than preregistration.
And &amp;lsquo;learn more faster&amp;rsquo; is not only Databrary&amp;rsquo;s tagline, is my personal motivation for adopting open science practices.
That ultimate goal can get lost in the sometimes devilish discussions about specific details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly moving my 
&lt;a href=&#34;/tags/poetry/&#34;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; into position on this site.
There may be scraps left in some corner of the hard drive, but the task is essentially done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were curious and inexplicable bursts and equally unexplained lapses.
Writing could be more of a habit were I more disciplined.
Instead, I await the midnight muse.
Something in those hours calls forth a form of loose thinking I require to write evocatively.
Not always well the record shows, but sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, too many, the poems respond to death or a close encounter, or other forms of heartbreak, including the self-inflicted sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gather them here because the desire to remember feels large to me.
And there are days when the past seems more real than the bewildering and inexplicable now.
I guess this is what real poets always knew.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I like about ham radio is the variety.
There are new modes to try and new things to learn all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the low power, weak signal 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://js8call.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JS8Call mode&lt;/a&gt;.
JS8Call takes the weak signal characteristics of the JT8 mode that has taken the ham world by storm, but enables actual ragchew-style QSOs.
This means that with low power, modest antennas, and poor propagation conditions, hams can have actual conversations with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents a significant departure from FT8 where callsigns, grid squares, and signal reports are about all that get exchanged.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played around with JT8, too, but the appeal seems limited to me.
Yes, my elmer got DXCC on FT8 in less than a month, and yes, I&amp;rsquo;m still working my way there on SSB.
But, JS8Call suits my interests more directly.
The developer, a guy named Jordan Scherer is an open source guru and all around righteous ham, and he has a plan about where this sort of tool might go.
Check out this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/mZKhVcFOljY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how my 25 W signal was getting out earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish it were otherwise, but I agree with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/trump-is-a-massive-failure-and-getting-exactly-what-he-wants.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;.
Regardless of what the Mueller report holds, Trump has severely damaged the country and made our Nation weaker, not stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regretably, Mr. Trump has been exactly the sort of president many of us feared he would be.
And his supporters, Donocrat and Trumpublican alike, actually like it that way.
That is the grim reality that his opponents must face.
His bombast and bluster and poutiness and pettiness appeal to large numbers of Americans.
This charlatan&amp;rsquo;s charlatan seems authentic to them in ways that other more competent and legitimate leaders do not.
Absent a meaningful challenge from within his own party, nowhere evident, that sentiment is unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/opinion/the-right-way-to-resist-trump.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this essay in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published before the dust of the 2016 election had truly settled.
Zingales argues that opponents of Italy&amp;rsquo;s Trump-like prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, learned the hard way that the only way to defeat a larger-than-life autocrat is to sweat the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian experience provides a blueprint for how to defeat Mr. Trump. Only two men in Italy have won an electoral competition against Mr. Berlusconi: Romano Prodi and the current prime minister, Matteo Renzi (albeit only in a 2014 European election). Both of them treated Mr. Berlusconi as an ordinary opponent. They focused on the issues, not on his character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficit has exploded, the border is insecure, North Korea remains a mortal threat to its neighbors, America&amp;rsquo;s reputation, power, and influence have declined, the rule of law has been weakened, and we have magnified the already challenges we must inevitably face in responding to climate change.
Trump has not, will not, and cannot make America great.
And his supporters have not, will not, and cannot acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/john_adams_134175&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John Adams said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.&amp;rdquo;
And it is the facts and evidence of Trump&amp;rsquo;s incompetence we must highlight, relentlessly and fearlessly, to defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you plan to attend the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) meeting in Baltimore later this week, you might be interested in some of the open science activities that will be taking place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, March 22, from 10-11:30 am, I am co-leading a conversation hour on the topic 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rick-gilmore.com/talk/srcd-2019-03-22/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What SRCD is doing to address open science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on a set of new policies and guidelines to authors that the SRCD Task Force on Scientific Integrity and Openness produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are other open science events happening at SRCD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ManyBabies: Bringing large-scale collaborative projects to infant development research&lt;/em&gt;, Saturday, March 23, 12:45-2:15 pm, Hilton Baltimore, Level 2, Key 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making developmental science more open: Successes, obstacles, and solutions&lt;/em&gt;, Saturday, March 23, 2:30-4:00 pm, Baltimore Convention Center, Room 309&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in Baltimore!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>April 9: A national day of reflection and reconciliation</title>
      <link>/post/april-9-a-day-of-reflection-and-reconciliation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/april-9-a-day-of-reflection-and-reconciliation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;America needs a holiday dedicated to reflecting on the many ways we have failed to meet our founding ideals.
We need such a holiday to reconcile the past with our common hopes for a better future, to &amp;lsquo;bind up the Nation&amp;rsquo;s wounds&amp;rsquo;, as Lincoln suggested in his 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_second_inaugural_address&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;second inaugural address&lt;/a&gt;.
I suggest we make April 9 that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee surrendered to Grant on April 9, 1865 in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, a month after Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s second inaugural.
This ended the military portion of the Civil War, the bloodiest conflict in American history.
But in a very real sense, the conflict never truly ended.
It simply shifted to other battlefields, several of which rage on today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that the American project is stronger when we, the people, view our history openly and honestly, with the courage to acknowledge our shortcomings.
Indeed, lacking such an honest accounting, our sense of pride may appear prideful or worse, willfully ignorant of the price so many have paid for this progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where and how has America fallen short?
My list may differ from yours, but here are some suggestions: Our genocide of Native Americans, our history of slavery, our treatment of any number of immigrant groups, the long delay in granting women suffrage, the Japanese internment, the ways 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/adam-serwer-madison-grant-white-nationalism/583258/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;American white supremacists inspired the Nazis&lt;/a&gt;, the interminable war on terror no one seems willing to end, and our failures to confront and address climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A truly great and powerful nation can muster the courage to face its own flaws and to hold itself account.
Indeed, lacking that courage, how can any people aspire to righteousness or assume the responsibilities of leadership?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Jews, who atone for sin on Yom Kippur by seeking forgiveness from one another before facing judgment from the almighty, let us set aside April 9 for a national day of reflection and reconciliation.
Let us find strength in examining our weakness.
And let such a day form a more perfect union among us that we may secure the blessings of liberty, as we the people have ordained in our Constitution, for all posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-18-031.html?utm_source=2018&amp;#43;Current&amp;#43;Member&amp;#43;List&amp;amp;utm_campaign=09227e70bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_17_08_03&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e5b504feb0-09227e70bd-293977841&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;requested input&lt;/a&gt; on a draft strategic plan for 2020-2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICHD supports Databrary and PLAY, and it has supported my habituation modeling work in the past.
The following is a draft response my colleagues and I are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Bianchi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the NICHD Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020-2024. We write as Principal Investigators of the Play &amp;amp; Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project (R01HD094830), a 65-researcher-strong video-based study of natural infant/mother behavior, funded by NICHD, NIMH, OBSSSR, and the Office of the Director. Our recommendation is simple: We urge you and your colleagues to incorporate a clear vision for behavioral research in the plan&amp;rsquo;s research themes and goals to underscore the pivotal importance of behavior and experience in child development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavior is the linchpin of the most vexing problems in public health, and a better understanding of behavior is fundamental to achieving positive health outcomes, from prenatal development throughout adulthood. Behavior contributes to the progression or prevention of disease, defines a disorder or marks recovery, and provides mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. The study of child health and human development magnifies this importance. According to the CDC, two of the three leading causes of death among children aged 1-4 (accidents and assault/homicide) and children aged 5- 14 (accidents and suicide) involve behavior, among other factors. One child in six has a developmental disability. The most common developmental disabilitiesâautism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sensory impairmentsâsubstantially impact behaviors across the lifespan, and often the most effective interventions are behavioral. Virtually every problem in children, families, and societyâsubstance use, school violence, school dropout, ethnic disparities, emotional dysregulation, racism and discrimination, and moreâcan be traced to behaviors and experiences in childhood. Moreover, the growing field of epigenetics reveals that genetics data alone provide limited insights about developmental outcomes without critical information about early experiences, behaviors, and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the NICHD 2020-2024 Strategic plan, our specific recommendations are as follows. In Research Theme #1âunderstanding early human developmentâwe ask that you expand the focus beyond genetic and cellular levels of analysis and incorporate maternal and fetal behavior as central phenomena that need to be studied and understood. Similarly, regarding Research Theme #2âsetting the stage for a healthy pregnancyâwe ask that you expand the focus to include maternal and other caregiver behaviors, including paternal behaviors, that may reduce or elevate risk.
Research Theme #4âidentifying sensitive time periods to optimize health interventionsâhighlights the role of behavior. However, the plan implies that we have sufficient knowledge about the varied trajectories of typical development to productively intervene in atypical development. This may be true in a limited set of domains, but is not broadly true in our experience. Much more research about behavioral development is needed. Our suggestion about Research Theme #5âImproving health during the transition from adolescence to adulthoodâis to broaden the lens to include research on childhood behaviors observed in a variety of settings that serve as precursors to risk in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish to emphasize that many standardized laboratory tasks or parent-report questionnaire instruments thought to reliably reflect the &amp;ldquo;phenotype,&amp;rdquo; fail to capture vital dimensions of infant, child, adolescent, and parent behavior that occur in natural settings. Indeed, this gap motivates our focus on video in the PLAY project. Natural behavior in home, school, and clinical settings can be reliably and informatively captured and analyzed using video. And we have shown that video can be securely and ethically shared using tools for video informatics (Databrary and Datavyu) and policies for restricted data sharing with explicit consent that we have developed and shared with the research community thanks to NICHD support (U01HD076595).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PLAY project capitalizes on these advances in an effort to capture, analyze, and openly share data about the building blocks of infant and maternal behavior combining video with other data sources. PLAY is motivated in part by the belief that the hard-won knowledge gleaned from public funding for the genome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome initiatives will have substantially greater impact on child and maternal health outcomes when combined with insights from a corresponding &amp;ldquo;behaviorome.&amp;rdquo; As a &amp;ldquo;behaviorome&amp;rdquo;-like research effort, PLAY aims to accelerate the pace of discovery in basic and applied developmental science.
NICHD has a strong track record of funding research on infant and child behavior. Given the essential role of behavior in maternal, child, and adolescent health, we urge NICHD to build upon this tradition by giving the study of behavior substantially greater emphasis and visibility in the 2020-2024 strategic plan and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours truly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Adolph, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, New York University&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick O. Gilmore, Associate Professor of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In search of the ethogram</title>
      <link>/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Psychology is in part, a science of behavior.
Mental experience &amp;ndash; thoughts and feelings &amp;ndash; are also common targets of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently went looking for a systematic catalogue of behaviors that should, in theory, constitute the substance of what psychologists and other behavioral scientists study.
My goal was to take that catalogue as a starting point for thinking about the relationship between information available for perception and the actions (behaviors) that this information informs.
The formal term for this sort of catalog is an &amp;lsquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethogram&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ethogram&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tolweb.org/onlinecontributors/app?page=TeacherResourceViewSupportMaterial&amp;amp;service=external&amp;amp;sp=l3090&amp;amp;sp=4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; from the Tree of Life project.
Unfortunately, I failed in my quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been attempts to create and openly share animal ethograms like the apparently stalled or inactive ethobank.org site associated with the EthoSource project.
The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cogpo.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cognitive Paradigm Ontology&lt;/a&gt; and the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cognitive Atlas&lt;/a&gt; project attempt to create systematic ontologies (systematic representations of categories and concepts and their relations) of tasks used in experimental psychology.
Cognitive psychology tasks clearly require very specific types of behavior from participants.
Systematically organizing the nature of these tasks should lead to faster progress in understanding how they relate to one another, and ultimately, how minds and brains actually work.
Still, I came up short in finding a comprehensive human ethogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other contexts, I&amp;rsquo;ve called such a thing the behaviorome, partly to suggest that behavior should have a more central place in research grantmaking priorities.
The 
&lt;a href=&#34;/project/PLAY/&#34;&gt;PLAY project&lt;/a&gt; is a type of behaviorome effort.
We will be creating detailed definitions for specific behaviors that our infant and adult participants produce in a small set of behavioral domains, but it will not be comprehensive by any means.
For now, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with trying to assemble my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach to an ethogram for humans could focus on biologically essential behavioral classes that we share with all other animals: &lt;em&gt;ingestion&lt;/em&gt; (food and nutrient seeking), &lt;em&gt;defense&lt;/em&gt; (self-protection), and &lt;em&gt;reproduction&lt;/em&gt;.
Unfortunately, this scheme fail to capture the sets of behaviors studied by the majority of psychologists.
Adding in a class of communicative and affiliative behaviors helps.
But even this augmented classification describes the functional purposes of behavior, not the behaviors themselves.
For example, locomotor behavior, moving toward or away from some target, occurs in food seeking, predator avoidance, mate seeking, and social (affiliative) contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to ask the question is to observe whether physical activities that humans do for pleasure and watch others for entertainment (sports) have some latent structure we might exploit.
Here, we assume that if large groups of humans engage in an activity or pay to watch others engage in it, the skills involved must be especially demanding.
Indeed, professional sports represent some of humankind&amp;rsquo;s most skilled (and highly paid) actors.
And while I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for a comprehensive catalog of sport types, this table shows that most of them fall into a small set of categories when focusing on the core actions that define success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Sports&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;aiming&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;basketball, baseball, football (passing &amp;amp; kicking), hocky, soccer, bowling, tennis, golf, pool/billiards, archery, &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;steering&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;slalom skiing, motorsports&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;performing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;gymnastics, diving, synchronized swimming, figure skating, &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;racing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;running, motorsports, speed skating, swimming, cycling, paddling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;fighting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boxing, wrestling, &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;feats of strength&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;weightlifting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may disagree with my categorization, but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that there are many similarities in the sorts of actions we find entertaining to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach to an ethogram starts with the actions that computer vision researchers find are important to extract from video.
Googleâs Atomic Visual Action (AVA) dataset (&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google.com/ava/&#34;&gt;https://research.google.com/ava/&lt;/a&gt;) involves three classes of movements, &lt;em&gt;person movement&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;object interaction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;person interaction&lt;/em&gt;, and has exemplars with 81 specific actions that fit into these categories.
Some examples of specific behaviors tagged in the AVA dataset are &lt;em&gt;crawl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;jump/leap&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lift&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;press&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hug&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;kiss&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;listen to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe some combination of these approaches is as good a start as any.
After all, if 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.03.018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;behavioral biologists don&amp;rsquo;t seem to agree about what constitutes behavior&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s not that surprising that psychologists haven&amp;rsquo;t yet created our own list.
We do need a list like this, though, don&amp;rsquo;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Florian Raudies, Swapnaa Jayaraman and I published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2015.7345450&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; where we simulated the optic flow that infants would experience in different head/body postures.
We computed cyclopian (one-eyed) flow on the basis of this schematic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilmore-lab/temple-2017-02-27/master/img/computing-flow.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the key parameters were the instantaneous translation &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((v_x{}, v_y{}, v_z{})\)&lt;/span&gt; and rotation &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((\omega_{x}, \omega_y{}, \omega_z{})\)&lt;/span&gt; of the planar retina.
Coupled with the optic flow equation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\begin{pmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \dot{y}\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{z} \begin{pmatrix}-f &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; x\\ 0 &amp;amp; -f &amp;amp; y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}{v_x{}}\\ {v_y{}} \\{v_z{}}\end{pmatrix}+ \frac{1}{f} \begin{pmatrix} xy &amp;amp; -(f^2+x^2) &amp;amp; fy\\ f^2+y^2 &amp;amp; -xy &amp;amp; -fy \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \omega_{x}\\ \omega_{y}\\ \omega_{z} \end{pmatrix}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we were able to simulate the &lt;em&gt;perceptual&lt;/em&gt; effects of postural geometry: Changes in eye height and forward translational speed that would occur when a child changed from crawling to walking altered the pattern of retinal flow &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((\dot{x}, \dot{y})\)&lt;/span&gt; in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has lain dormant for a few years, but I now want to pick it back up.
In short, there are a handful of perception/action systems that provide the nervous system with deterministic, causal information about the effects of different actions.
These must be important for development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next step, Iâm looking for a concise, but thorough parameterization of body posture that includes the eyes, head, torso, arms, and legs.
Hereâs a sketch of what I have in mind for the upper parts body that have the greatest impact on the direction of visual fixation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Body part&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Parameter(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$&lt;em&gt;{rx}, &lt;/em&gt;{ry}, &lt;em&gt;{lx}, &lt;/em&gt;{lx} $&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Head&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\theta_x{}, \theta_y{}, \theta_z{}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Torso&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$_x{}, _y{}, _z{} $&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupled with the distance between the eyes, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;, the radial distance to the headâs center of rotation, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the distance from the headâs center of rotation to the torsoâs center of rotation, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can compute the effects of eye, head, and torso movement on visual motion at the two retinae.
Now, if the &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt; signals from eye vs.Â head vs.Â torso can be distinguished, then these could couple with other proprioceptive (muscle, tendon, cutaneous) signals to provide a powerful set of &lt;em&gt;sensory&lt;/em&gt; signals that are directly caused by eye, head, and torso motion.
See &lt;a href=&#34;../the-webs-we-weave/&#34;&gt;this earlier post&lt;/a&gt; for a causal graph that elaborates on this point.
Iâll discuss why I think there are &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt; differences in the effects of eye and head motion in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step is to ask my colleagues in kinesiology if there is a canonical parameterization of body position that I can build upon.
If you know of one, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâve been âsketchingâ out conceptual models for some time without realizing that there is an entire field of analysis where these sorts of diagrams are the starting point: Causal modeling. My introduction to this world was Judea Pearlâs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1548436587&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+book+of+why&#34;&gt;The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect&lt;/a&gt;. Interested casual readers might also enjoy Steve Slomanâs excellent and delightfully clear &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Causal-Models-People-Think-Alternatives/dp/0195394291/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1548436730&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=steven+sloman&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Causal Models: How People Think About the World and Its Alternatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to build a model for how an observer perceives visual motion given various possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure implies that motion on the retina comes from the movement of objects in the environment, movement of the observer, specifically the eyes, head, or body, or a combination of any of these. Eye movements stem from eye movement commands; head movements (translations and rotations) stem from head movement commands; body movements stem from commands to move the body. Movements of the eyes, head, or body generate proprioceptive signals from the eyes, head, and body. These signals derive from muscle, joint, and tendon receptors. Rotational and translational motion of the head stimulates vestibular signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that retinal motion caused by the observer has multiple non-visual correlates (or consequences) that are detectable under typical circumstances. There may also be differences in the specific &lt;em&gt;properties&lt;/em&gt; of motion caused by eye, head, body, or object motion. Weâll discuss these in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the task for perception is to answer the question: Whatâs moving and why?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, my friend Mike (N3LI) and I made our first-ever CW QSOs.
In ham-speak, that means we chatted using Morse code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t fast, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t copy each other completely.
But we exchanged meaningful information using a classic communication mode that is no longer a requirement for licensing but is still going strong.
It was great fun, and we plan to keep practicing and plan to meet-up again next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-learning Morse code has reinforced several things for me.
Patience and persistence are the most important qualities for long-term mastery of any difficult skill.
And it&amp;rsquo;s good to give older brains a tough, but realizable challenge.
Especially when there are concrete and visible measures of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any no-code hams out there who haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the plunge, come on in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New lab logo</title>
      <link>/post/new-lab-logo/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/new-lab-logo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how many years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted a lab logo.
I thought that designing a logo was something that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; student might actually enjoy doing.
But I never pushed or insisted, and so it never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as a byproduct of a bunch of reading I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing about causal modeling and the philosophy of science, I came up with a figure that seems to work on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/nested-causality.jpg.png&#34; height=150px/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer circle represents the world, the next circle the body that is embedded in the world, the next the nervous system embedded in that body (in the world), and the smallest the mind embedded in the brain (in the body in the world).
The world, body, and brain are directly measurable in various ways.
The mind is not.
We infer properties and structures of the mind indirectly, through patterns of brain activity or peripheral physiology or behavior.
The focal point of psychology as a science is making inferences about something that cannot be directly measured.
This is one reason psychology is harder than physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure has other associations.
It is similar to one used to demonstrate that rotational motion in 2 dimensions can evoke the perception of an object in 3 dimensions &amp;ndash; something called the stereokinetic depth effect (SKE).
It evokes the perception of a cone-like shape protruding up and to the left.
And it evokes a weaker perception of a tunnel.
I study depth perception and motion perception, so these features make the figure even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the figure could be viewed as a large letter O, for openness, something I now embrace in all aspects of my scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess that I was just trying a new way to depict the embedded causal relationships among mind, brain, body, and the environment and found a color scheme I liked.
The rest was purely accidental.
But I guess invention is like that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building walls and tearing them down</title>
      <link>/post/building-walls-and-tearing-them-down/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/building-walls-and-tearing-them-down/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The building of walls is of much concern these days.
This song from Anais Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s folk opera &amp;ldquo;Hadestown&amp;rdquo; sheds light on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; some of us want so desperately to build them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8sQ8R54C53o&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must also wonder what future Mexican leader will call on us to tear down the wall we seem so desperate to build?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCO9BYCGNeY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walls are no symbol of strength.
They shut in more than they keep out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Iâve been developing an R package that interacts with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://databrary.org&#34;&gt;Databrary.org&lt;/a&gt; API and with &lt;a href=&#34;https://datavyu.org&#34;&gt;Datavyu&lt;/a&gt; annotation files stored locally or on Databrary alongside shared videos. If youâre curious, you can download the &lt;code&gt;databraryapi&lt;/code&gt; package from this GitHub repository: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many people in the software world, Iâm entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agricultureâs Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience. But my R package development skills are entirely self-taught. I must thank the incredibly generous geniuses who have gone before me and who share their code and their talents so freely and openly. Without the almost instant availability of these resources, my progress would be much, much slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are an opinionated bunch, and there are at least as many styles (fads?) in software development as their are developers. One style that I have started to try to emulate is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;âtest-driven developmentâ&lt;/a&gt;. In TDD, the idea is that you create tests for how each part of your package should respond given this or that input. If your tests are through enough and correct, your package should workâ¦at least within the boundaries of what you tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latest version of the package (0.1.4), I added a bunch of new tests to evaluate several new functions Iâve added to the package. Letâs just say that getting through my own self-designed test battery was challenging. But as a result, the code is cleaner and less buggy than it would be if I hadnât gone this route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the larger sense, TDD is sort of a âplan for the worstâ style. I like it because I know it forces me to be more precise and specific than I might otherwise choose to be. Since Iâve been using the &lt;code&gt;databraryapi&lt;/code&gt; more often for keeping tabs on whatâs going on in the Databrary world, thatâs a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case youâre curious what the package can do, check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Skipping install of &amp;#39;databraryapi&amp;#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (a6a700ea) has not changed since last install.
##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of some recently authorized researchers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;databraryapi::get_db_stats(&amp;quot;people&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 6
##      id sortname  prename     affiliation               url   institution
##   &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;                     &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;lgl&amp;gt;      
## 1  4744 Tadepalli Prasad      Oregon State University   &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;  NA         
## 2  4871 Black     Jessica Jan Saint Vincent College     &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;  NA         
## 3  4477 Prull     Matthew     Whitman College           &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;  NA         
## 4   753 Childers  Jane        Trinity University        &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;  NA         
## 5  4881 Lindskog  Marcus      Uppsala University        &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;  NA         
## 6  4852 Hudson    Danae       Missouri State University &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;  NA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is a very simple plot of the growth in authorized researchers and institutions over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;with(databraryapi::read_csv_data_as_df(), plot(Auth_Investigators, Institutions))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-12-28-test-driven-development-is-hard-and-important_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve said in other places that I think scientists will eventually interact with their data programmatically â via scripts like this â with the data and materials stored in repositories that others can also access programmatically. Furthermore, I think that the philosophy of test-driven development can help make our software AND the results and findings we derive from it more robust and reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ending the endless war</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find Andrew Sullivan worth reading almost all of the time even if I disagree with him.
This 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/andrew-sullivan-establishment-will-never-say-no-to-a-war.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, I agree completely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip;I simply do not believe that the West has the knowledge, the will, or the ability to shape the extremely complicated and endlessly vicious politics of the Middle East. And I defy anyone to show otherwise&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I find the present occupant completely unfit for office, I applaud his announcement to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and reduce our presence in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forget that &lt;em&gt;Congress&lt;/em&gt; has the Constitutional power to declare war or decisively choose not to.
It&amp;rsquo;s part of the balance of powers created by the Framers.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to see Congress restore balance here and in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
