      <description>Psychology is in part, a science of behavior. Mental experience &amp;ndash; thoughts and feelings &amp;ndash; are also common targets of inquiry.
I recently went looking for a systematic catalogue of behaviors that should, in theory, constitute the substance of what psychologists and other behavioral scientists study. My goal was to take that catalogue as a starting point for thinking about the relationship between information available for perception and the actions (behaviors) that this information informs.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, Florian Raudies, Swapnaa Jayaraman and I published a paper where we simulated the optic flow that infants would experience in different head/body postures. We computed cyclopian (one-eyed) flow on the basis of this schematic:
Here, the key parameters were the instantaneous translation \((v_x{}, v_y{}, v_z{})\) and rotation \((\omega_{x}, \omega_y{}, \omega_z{})\) of the planar retina. Coupled with the optic flow equation,
\(\begin{pmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \dot{y}\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{z} \begin{pmatrix}-f &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; x\\ 0 &amp;amp; -f &amp;amp; y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}{v_x{}}\\ {v_y{}} \\{v_z{}}\end{pmatrix}+ \frac{1}{f} \begin{pmatrix} xy &amp;amp; -(f^2+x^2) &amp;amp; fy\\ f^2+y^2 &amp;amp; -xy &amp;amp; -fy \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \omega_{x}\\ \omega_{y}\\ \omega_{z} \end{pmatrix}\)</description>

      <description>I’ve been ‘sketching’ out conceptual models for some time without realizing that there is an entire field of analysis where these sorts of diagrams are the starting point: Causal modeling. My introduction to this world was Judea Pearl’s The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect. Interested casual readers might also enjoy Steve Sloman’s excellent and delightfully clear Causal Models: How People Think About the World and Its Alternatives.</description>

      <description>Last night, my friend Mike (N3LI) and I made our first-ever CW QSOs. In ham-speak, that means we chatted using Morse code.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t fast, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t copy each other completely. But we exchanged meaningful information using a classic communication mode that is no longer a requirement for licensing but is still going strong. It was great fun, and we plan to keep practicing and plan to meet-up again next week.</description>

      <title>New lab logo</title>

      <description>For I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how many years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted a lab logo. I thought that designing a logo was something that some student might actually enjoy doing. But I never pushed or insisted, and so it never happened.
Then, as a byproduct of a bunch of reading I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing about causal modeling and the philosophy of science, I came up with a figure that seems to work on several levels.</description>

      <title>Building walls and tearing them down</title>

      <description>The building of walls is of much concern these days. This song from Anais Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s folk opera &amp;ldquo;Hadestown&amp;rdquo; sheds light on why some of us want so desperately to build them:
 I must also wonder what future Mexican leader will call on us to tear down the wall we seem so desperate to build?
 Walls are no symbol of strength. They shut in more than they keep out.</description>

      <description>I’ve been developing an R package that interacts with the Databrary.org API and with Datavyu annotation files stored locally or on Databrary alongside shared videos. If you’re curious, you can download the databraryapi package from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi.
Like many people in the software world, I’m entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience.</description>

      <description>Hi, all.
After a break, I&amp;rsquo;m back to blogging using the blogdown package for R, and the Hugo Academic theme. Let me know what you think.</description>

      <description>I find Andrew Sullivan worth reading almost all of the time even if I disagree with him. This time, I agree completely:
 &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;I simply do not believe that the West has the knowledge, the will, or the ability to shape the extremely complicated and endlessly vicious politics of the Middle East. And I defy anyone to show otherwise&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;
 So, while I find the present occupant completely unfit for office, I applaud his announcement to withdraw U.</description>
