      <description>&lt;p&gt;we fear the people who love their guns&lt;/br&gt;
more than we love our children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the atheist prays every day to gods she finds incomprehensible:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the sticks of destruction&lt;/br&gt;
from our arsenals and minds.&lt;/br&gt;
Banish them to eternity.&lt;/br&gt;
Cleanse us that we may be clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a merciful god would hear this supplicant,&lt;/br&gt;
know her grace, &lt;/br&gt;
and answer in the affirmative.&lt;/br&gt;
a god who loved his children&lt;/br&gt;
would, she thinks and hopes.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but we could surely find other ways of killing, you object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes, I acknowledge,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or perhaps&lt;/br&gt;
just perhaps&lt;/br&gt;
choose not to.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself at odds recently with colleagues who, like me, view themselves as advocates for open science.
This post attempts to clarify what I see as the crux of our disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-don-t-own-our-data&#34;&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t own our data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most researchers feel a strong sense of ownership about our data and often, properly so I think, feel especially protective of our research participants.
The fact remains, however, that despite our essential role in determining what data get collected from whom and how, we researchers have the weakest claim to actually &lt;em&gt;owning&lt;/em&gt; the data we collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., if my work is funded by a grant from the Federal government (e.g., NSF or NIH), then that award is actually made to &lt;em&gt;my institution&lt;/em&gt;, not me.
In fact, if I am unable to fulfill the obligations of the award, my institution may, and often will, appoint another person to do so.
If my work is funded by another source, that source is likely to have implemented similar provisions.
So, in reality, while researchers have a primary stewardship role over research data, it likely belongs to our institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other contexts, the EU, for example, strong arguments have been made that &lt;em&gt;research participants&lt;/em&gt; actually own their data.
I am sympathetic to these arguments and believe that empowering individuals to grant researchers specific permission to use their data is the best path toward a future of ethical data use.
Implementing that vision at-scale poses substantial challenges I believe academic researchers can eventually meet.
The point of convergence is that researchers don&amp;rsquo;t own the data we collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not owning the data nevertheless means that we researchers must still think carefully about how best to protect it, our participants, and our institutions.
As a practical matter, even though our institutions (or research participants) may own the data, we are the ones best positioned to determine what happens to those data when our project ends.
In other words, the responsibility for determining the future life, if any, of our research data is one we can&amp;rsquo;t meaningfully shirk or easily ignore.
At the same time, because the data aren&amp;rsquo;t really ours,  considerations about any personal or career risk associated with sharing data can&amp;rsquo;t be at the center of the discussion.
Instead, our obligations to research participants, our institutions, and funding agencies must take precedence.
This means that fear of being scooped probably isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient justification to withhold sharing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-data-publicly-without-restriction-is-unnecessary-and-poses-unforseen-risks&#34;&gt;Sharing data publicly without restriction is unnecessary and poses unforseen risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that some of my colleagues who are skeptical about data sharing understand the practice to mean sharing data in publicly accessible ways.
These skeptics argue that they don&amp;rsquo;t have permission to share data that way, and thus doing so would violate research ethics.
I agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I go further.
I am worried that we woefully underestimate the risks of participant reidentifiability associated with combining public and private data sets, even when research data have been stripped of conventional identifiers.
Imagine if Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump had taken intro psych classes and the &amp;lsquo;deidentified&amp;rsquo; data were publicly available to anyone today.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it seem likely, certain even, that large well-funded teams of data scientists would be scouring the internet in order to try to expose Bernie&amp;rsquo;s answer to this survey question or Donald&amp;rsquo;s score on that cognitive test?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t predict the future, but we can try to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than make open, public sharing of data about human beings the expected norm, I suggest we build on an existing track-record of sharing these sorts data with restricted audiences.
The Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research (&lt;a href=&#34;https://icpsr.umich.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICSPR&lt;/a&gt;) at the University of Michigan has been storing and sharing data with restricted audiences for almost 60 years.
The U.S. Census has developed procedures for allowing restricted access to individual Census survey responses in highly secure and protected environments.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://databrary.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Databrary&lt;/a&gt; data library that I co-founded and co-direct has created a data library for openly sharing video and audio recordings with a restricted community of researchers.
There are numerous examples of data sets shared by the U.S. government (e.g., NDAR) that have various restrictions on who can access data and for what purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples illustrate that open data sharing need not be synonymous with public data sharing.
The ICPSR and Census examples especially show that even the most sensitive data can be successfully shared with responsible researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, restricted sharing with researchers affiliated with institutions of higher learning or academic medical centers is &amp;lsquo;elitist&amp;rsquo; to some degree.
But the checks and balances these institutions provide &amp;ndash; research ethics training, research review committees, research supervision, secure data storage infrastructure &amp;ndash; protect research participants in ways that public data sharing schemes simply cannot, at least not now.
I think this form of elitism is justified in the name of protecting research participants.
Or at the very least, that restricting data about human participants should be the norm unless and until we can be highly confident that public sharing truly poses minimal risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I conclude the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually all data about human research participants can be shared in some form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard for sharing data about human research participants should be to use a data repository that restricts access to specific individuals for purposes subject to external review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All researchers who collect data about human research participants should be collecting permission to share information from their participants so that any data sharing activities are in accord with participants&amp;rsquo; wishes. There are readily available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.databrary.org/resources/templates.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; researchers can adapt for seeking sharing permission. Going forward there is no reason for &amp;lsquo;failure to secure permission to share&amp;rsquo; to be a meaningful impediment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, some may argue that the cost of securing permission to share and storing data in restricted repositories versus publicly accessible places must be weighed against the benefits.
I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree that costs and benefits must be weighed, but it is often hard to weigh them objectively.
Instead, I think it is safer to say that we have a longer history of and familiarity with restricted data sharing and more information about the costs of preparing data to share in these sorts of settings.
So the surer bet in the long-term is to build on what has already been working.
The risks of widespread public data sharing are a &amp;lsquo;known-unknown&amp;rsquo;, in Donald Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s categorical scheme, while the risks of restricted data sharing are &amp;lsquo;known-knowns&amp;rsquo;.
I do not share Mr. Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s politics, but I find his thinking incisive and useful  in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final point in favor of restricted sharing in centralized repositories is metadata standardization.
If we view data sharing as an investment in future scholarship, then sharing data in standard ways that others can combine, reuse, and build upon is essential.
By design (e.g., Databrary, government-sponsored data repositories) or long-standing practice (ICSPSR), data repositories provide standard metadata elements that make data more readily discoverable and reusable.
Of course, curating data to meet these metadata standards takes time, but the payoff comes in accelerated resuse and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, data about human participants should be shared (with permission) in data repositories that restrict access and support standardized metadata, and all of us who do research with human participants should be seeking explicit permission to share in these ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-data-materials-and-analysis-scripts-is-more-important-to-open-science-than-pre-registration&#34;&gt;Sharing data, materials, and analysis scripts is more important to open science than pre-registration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greatly admire the efforts of the team at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cos.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt; in bringing preregistration and registered reports into widespread scientific discussion and making them a much more common practice.
There is no question that drawing clearer, brighter lines between confirmatory and exploratory analyses improves the quality of scientific inference and mitigates questionable research practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I get the biggest and hardest push-back from colleagues about preregistration when discussing open science practices.
One reason is that many people find the process of pregistration difficult, frustrating, and onerous.
Yes, there are lots of templates to choose from, and yes, many of the details are already in our IRB protocols or grant proposals.
But even so, the benefits of pre-registration seem small relative to the high costs, especially to skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, and innate pragmatism, I spend more of my energy talking-up data sharing.
Data are more interesting to me personally and probably more useful in evaluating the impact and importance of a given piece of work than a detailed preregistration plan.
One of my graduate school mentors told me that he reads a paper&amp;rsquo;s methods and results first, and only after that decides whether to read the introduction and conclusion.
Frankly, if the data aren&amp;rsquo;t interesting or the effects clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t care that much what the authors predicted or how they tortured the data.
And by extension, if the effect is strong, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to matter much whether the authors predicted it or not.
Further, I&amp;rsquo;ve found no convincing retort to the skeptics who ask me why I think someone actually followed their preregistered procedure.
In short, I think that most studies on human participants are under-powered and that we need to vastly increase the quantity of shared data in order to address problems of estimating true effect size distributions.
While I may not really know whether a researcher followed the protocol reported in a manuscript or in their preregistration, I can evaluate the size of the reported effect and hopefully combine it with other datasets&amp;hellip;if the data are shared.
When push comes to shove, I&amp;rsquo;d rather authors commit to open data sharing and carry through on their commitments than encourage people to preregister but have them stop short of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while I&amp;rsquo;m completely happy endorsing the virtues of preregistration, I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep asking authors of papers I review, most of which are not preregistered, to share their data.
That&amp;rsquo;s because I think data, materials, and analysis code sharing is ultimately more important to advancing discovery than preregistration.
And &amp;lsquo;learn more faster&amp;rsquo; is not only Databrary&amp;rsquo;s tagline, is my personal motivation for adopting open science practices.
That ultimate goal can get lost in the sometimes devilish discussions about specific details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly moving my &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/poetry/&#34;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; into position on this site.
There may be scraps left in some corner of the hard drive, but the task is essentially done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were curious and inexplicable bursts and equally unexplained lapses.
Writing could be more of a habit were I more disciplined.
Instead, I await the midnight muse.
Something in those hours calls forth a form of loose thinking I require to write evocatively.
Not always well the record shows, but sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times, too many, the poems respond to death or a close encounter, or other forms of heartbreak, including the self-inflicted sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gather them here because the desire to remember feels large to me.
And there are days when the past seems more real than the bewildering and inexplicable now.
I guess this is what real poets always knew.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If you JS8...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I like about ham radio is the variety.
There are new modes to try and new things to learn all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the low power, weak signal &lt;a href=&#34;http://js8call.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JS8Call mode&lt;/a&gt;.
JS8Call takes the weak signal characteristics of the JT8 mode that has taken the ham world by storm, but enables actual ragchew-style QSOs.
This means that with low power, modest antennas, and poor propagation conditions, hams can have actual conversations with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents a significant departure from FT8 where callsigns, grid squares, and signal reports are about all that get exchanged.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played around with JT8, too, but the appeal seems limited to me.
Yes, my elmer got DXCC on FT8 in less than a month, and yes, I&amp;rsquo;m still working my way there on SSB.
But, JS8Call suits my interests more directly.
The developer, a guy named Jordan Scherer is an open source guru and all around righteous ham, and he has a plan about where this sort of tool might go.
Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/mZKhVcFOljY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how my 25 W signal was getting out earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Of Donocrats and Trumpublicans</title>
      <link>/post/of-donocrats-and-trumpublicans/</link>

      <guid>/post/of-donocrats-and-trumpublicans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish it were otherwise, but I agree with &lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/trump-is-a-massive-failure-and-getting-exactly-what-he-wants.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;.
Regardless of what the Mueller report holds, Trump has severely damaged the country and made our Nation weaker, not stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regretably, Mr. Trump has been exactly the sort of president many of us feared he would be.
And his supporters, Donocrat and Trumpublican alike, actually like it that way.
That is the grim reality that his opponents must face.
His bombast and bluster and poutiness and pettiness appeal to large numbers of Americans.
This charlatan&amp;rsquo;s charlatan seems authentic to them in ways that other more competent and legitimate leaders do not.
Absent a meaningful challenge from within his own party, nowhere evident, that sentiment is unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/opinion/the-right-way-to-resist-trump.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this essay in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published before the dust of the 2016 election had truly settled.
Zingales argues that opponents of Italy&amp;rsquo;s Trump-like prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, learned the hard way that the only way to defeat a larger-than-life autocrat is to sweat the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian experience provides a blueprint for how to defeat Mr. Trump. Only two men in Italy have won an electoral competition against Mr. Berlusconi: Romano Prodi and the current prime minister, Matteo Renzi (albeit only in a 2014 European election). Both of them treated Mr. Berlusconi as an ordinary opponent. They focused on the issues, not on his character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deficit has exploded, the border is insecure, North Korea remains a mortal threat to its neighbors, America&amp;rsquo;s reputation, power, and influence have declined, the rule of law has been weakened, and we have magnified the already challenges we must inevitably face in responding to climate change.
Trump has not, will not, and cannot make America great.
And his supporters have not, will not, and cannot acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/john_adams_134175&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John Adams said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.&amp;rdquo;
And it is the facts and evidence of Trump&amp;rsquo;s incompetence we must highlight, relentlessly and fearlessly, to defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you plan to attend the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) meeting in Baltimore later this week, you might be interested in some of the open science activities that will be taking place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, March 22, from 10-11:30 am, I am co-leading a conversation hour on the topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rick-gilmore.com/talk/srcd-2019-03-22/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What SRCD is doing to address open science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on a set of new policies and guidelines to authors that the SRCD Task Force on Scientific Integrity and Openness produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are other open science events happening at SRCD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ManyBabies: Bringing large-scale collaborative projects to infant development research&lt;/em&gt;, Saturday, March 23, 12:45-2:15 pm, Hilton Baltimore, Level 2, Key 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making developmental science more open: Successes, obstacles, and solutions&lt;/em&gt;, Saturday, March 23, 2:30-4:00 pm, Baltimore Convention Center, Room 309&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in Baltimore!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>April 9: A national day of reflection and reconciliation</title>
      <link>/post/april-9-a-day-of-reflection-and-reconciliation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/april-9-a-day-of-reflection-and-reconciliation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;America needs a holiday dedicated to reflecting on the many ways we have failed to meet our founding ideals.
We need such a holiday to reconcile the past with our common hopes for a better future, to &amp;lsquo;bind up the Nation&amp;rsquo;s wounds&amp;rsquo;, as Lincoln suggested in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_second_inaugural_address&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;second inaugural address&lt;/a&gt;.
I suggest we make April 9 that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee surrendered to Grant on April 9, 1865 in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, a month after Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s second inaugural.
This ended the military portion of the Civil War, the bloodiest conflict in American history.
But in a very real sense, the conflict never truly ended.
It simply shifted to other battlefields, several of which rage on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that the American project is stronger when we, the people, view our history openly and honestly, with the courage to acknowledge our shortcomings.
Indeed, lacking such an honest accounting, our sense of pride may appear prideful or worse, willfully ignorant of the price so many have paid for this progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where and how has America fallen short?
My list may differ from yours, but here are some suggestions: Our genocide of Native Americans, our history of slavery, our treatment of any number of immigrant groups, the long delay in granting women suffrage, the Japanese internment, the ways &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/adam-serwer-madison-grant-white-nationalism/583258/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;American white supremacists inspired the Nazis&lt;/a&gt;, the interminable war on terror no one seems willing to end, and our failures to confront and address climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly great and powerful nation can muster the courage to face its own flaws and to hold itself account.
Indeed, lacking that courage, how can any people aspire to righteousness or assume the responsibilities of leadership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Jews, who atone for sin on Yom Kippur by seeking forgiveness from one another before facing judgment from the almighty, let us set aside April 9 for a national day of reflection and reconciliation.
Let us find strength in examining our weakness.
And let such a day form a more perfect union among us that we may secure the blessings of liberty, as we the people have ordained in our Constitution, for all posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has &lt;a href=&#34;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-18-031.html?utm_source=2018+Current+Member+List&amp;amp;utm_campaign=09227e70bd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_17_08_03&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e5b504feb0-09227e70bd-293977841&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;requested input&lt;/a&gt; on a draft strategic plan for 2020-2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NICHD supports Databrary and PLAY, and it has supported my habituation modeling work in the past.
The following is a draft response my colleagues and I are working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Bianchi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the NICHD Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020-2024. We write as Principal Investigators of the Play &amp;amp; Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project (R01HD094830), a 65-researcher-strong video-based study of natural infant/mother behavior, funded by NICHD, NIMH, OBSSSR, and the Office of the Director. Our recommendation is simple: We urge you and your colleagues to incorporate a clear vision for behavioral research in the plan&amp;rsquo;s research themes and goals to underscore the pivotal importance of behavior and experience in child development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior is the linchpin of the most vexing problems in public health, and a better understanding of behavior is fundamental to achieving positive health outcomes, from prenatal development throughout adulthood. Behavior contributes to the progression or prevention of disease, defines a disorder or marks recovery, and provides mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. The study of child health and human development magnifies this importance. According to the CDC, two of the three leading causes of death among children aged 1-4 (accidents and assault/homicide) and children aged 5- 14 (accidents and suicide) involve behavior, among other factors. One child in six has a developmental disability. The most common developmental disabilities—autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sensory impairments—substantially impact behaviors across the lifespan, and often the most effective interventions are behavioral. Virtually every problem in children, families, and society—substance use, school violence, school dropout, ethnic disparities, emotional dysregulation, racism and discrimination, and more—can be traced to behaviors and experiences in childhood. Moreover, the growing field of epigenetics reveals that genetics data alone provide limited insights about developmental outcomes without critical information about early experiences, behaviors, and environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the NICHD 2020-2024 Strategic plan, our specific recommendations are as follows. In Research Theme #1—understanding early human development—we ask that you expand the focus beyond genetic and cellular levels of analysis and incorporate maternal and fetal behavior as central phenomena that need to be studied and understood. Similarly, regarding Research Theme #2—setting the stage for a healthy pregnancy—we ask that you expand the focus to include maternal and other caregiver behaviors, including paternal behaviors, that may reduce or elevate risk.
Research Theme #4—identifying sensitive time periods to optimize health interventions—highlights the role of behavior. However, the plan implies that we have sufficient knowledge about the varied trajectories of typical development to productively intervene in atypical development. This may be true in a limited set of domains, but is not broadly true in our experience. Much more research about behavioral development is needed. Our suggestion about Research Theme #5—Improving health during the transition from adolescence to adulthood—is to broaden the lens to include research on childhood behaviors observed in a variety of settings that serve as precursors to risk in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish to emphasize that many standardized laboratory tasks or parent-report questionnaire instruments thought to reliably reflect the &amp;ldquo;phenotype,&amp;rdquo; fail to capture vital dimensions of infant, child, adolescent, and parent behavior that occur in natural settings. Indeed, this gap motivates our focus on video in the PLAY project. Natural behavior in home, school, and clinical settings can be reliably and informatively captured and analyzed using video. And we have shown that video can be securely and ethically shared using tools for video informatics (Databrary and Datavyu) and policies for restricted data sharing with explicit consent that we have developed and shared with the research community thanks to NICHD support (U01HD076595).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAY project capitalizes on these advances in an effort to capture, analyze, and openly share data about the building blocks of infant and maternal behavior combining video with other data sources. PLAY is motivated in part by the belief that the hard-won knowledge gleaned from public funding for the genome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome initiatives will have substantially greater impact on child and maternal health outcomes when combined with insights from a corresponding &amp;ldquo;behaviorome.&amp;rdquo; As a &amp;ldquo;behaviorome&amp;rdquo;-like research effort, PLAY aims to accelerate the pace of discovery in basic and applied developmental science.
NICHD has a strong track record of funding research on infant and child behavior. Given the essential role of behavior in maternal, child, and adolescent health, we urge NICHD to build upon this tradition by giving the study of behavior substantially greater emphasis and visibility in the 2020-2024 strategic plan and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours truly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen Adolph, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, New York University&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rick O. Gilmore, Associate Professor of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In search of the ethogram</title>
      <link>/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/</link>

      <guid>/post/in-search-of-the-ethogram/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Psychology is in part, a science of behavior.
Mental experience &amp;ndash; thoughts and feelings &amp;ndash; are also common targets of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently went looking for a systematic catalogue of behaviors that should, in theory, constitute the substance of what psychologists and other behavioral scientists study.
My goal was to take that catalogue as a starting point for thinking about the relationship between information available for perception and the actions (behaviors) that this information informs.
The formal term for this sort of catalog is an &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethogram&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ethogram&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample &lt;a href=&#34;http://tolweb.org/onlinecontributors/app?page=TeacherResourceViewSupportMaterial&amp;amp;service=external&amp;amp;sp=l3090&amp;amp;sp=4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; from the Tree of Life project.
Unfortunately, I failed in my quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been attempts to create and openly share animal ethograms like the apparently stalled or inactive ethobank.org site associated with the EthoSource project.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cogpo.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cognitive Paradigm Ontology&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cognitive Atlas&lt;/a&gt; project attempt to create systematic ontologies (systematic representations of categories and concepts and their relations) of tasks used in experimental psychology.
Cognitive psychology tasks clearly require very specific types of behavior from participants.
Systematically organizing the nature of these tasks should lead to faster progress in understanding how they relate to one another, and ultimately, how minds and brains actually work.
Still, I came up short in finding a comprehensive human ethogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other contexts, I&amp;rsquo;ve called such a thing the behaviorome, partly to suggest that behavior should have a more central place in research grantmaking priorities.
The &lt;a href=&#34;/project/PLAY/&#34;&gt;PLAY project&lt;/a&gt; is a type of behaviorome effort.
We will be creating detailed definitions for specific behaviors that our infant and adult participants produce in a small set of behavioral domains, but it will not be comprehensive by any means.
For now, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with trying to assemble my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to an ethogram for humans could focus on biologically essential behavioral classes that we share with all other animals: &lt;em&gt;ingestion&lt;/em&gt; (food and nutrient seeking), &lt;em&gt;defense&lt;/em&gt; (self-protection), and &lt;em&gt;reproduction&lt;/em&gt;.
Unfortunately, this scheme fail to capture the sets of behaviors studied by the majority of psychologists.
Adding in a class of communicative and affiliative behaviors helps.
But even this augmented classification describes the functional purposes of behavior, not the behaviors themselves.
For example, locomotor behavior, moving toward or away from some target, occurs in food seeking, predator avoidance, mate seeking, and social (affiliative) contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to ask the question is to observe whether physical activities that humans do for pleasure and watch others for entertainment (sports) have some latent structure we might exploit.
Here, we assume that if large groups of humans engage in an activity or pay to watch others engage in it, the skills involved must be especially demanding.
Indeed, professional sports represent some of humankind&amp;rsquo;s most skilled (and highly paid) actors.
And while I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for a comprehensive catalog of sport types, this table shows that most of them fall into a small set of categories when focusing on the core actions that define success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Sports&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;aiming&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;basketball, baseball, football (passing &amp;amp; kicking), hocky, soccer, bowling, tennis, golf, pool/billiards, archery, &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;steering&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;slalom skiing, motorsports&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;performing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;gymnastics, diving, synchronized swimming, figure skating, &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;racing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;running, motorsports, speed skating, swimming, cycling, paddling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;fighting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boxing, wrestling, &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;feats of strength&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;weightlifting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may disagree with my categorization, but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that there are many similarities in the sorts of actions we find entertaining to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach to an ethogram starts with the actions that computer vision researchers find are important to extract from video.
Google’s Atomic Visual Action (AVA) dataset (&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google.com/ava/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://research.google.com/ava/&lt;/a&gt;) involves three classes of movements, &lt;em&gt;person movement&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;object interaction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;person interaction&lt;/em&gt;, and has exemplars with 81 specific actions that fit into these categories.
Some examples of specific behaviors tagged in the AVA dataset are &lt;em&gt;crawl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;jump/leap&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lift&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;press&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hug&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;kiss&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;listen to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe some combination of these approaches is as good a start as any.
After all, if &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.03.018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;behavioral biologists don&amp;rsquo;t seem to agree about what constitutes behavior&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s not that surprising that psychologists haven&amp;rsquo;t yet created our own list.
We do need a list like this, though, don&amp;rsquo;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Florian Raudies, Swapnaa Jayaraman and I published a &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2015.7345450&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; where we simulated the optic flow that infants would experience in different head/body postures. We computed cyclopian (one-eyed) flow on the basis of this schematic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilmore-lab/temple-2017-02-27/master/img/computing-flow.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the key parameters were the instantaneous translation &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((v_x{}, v_y{}, v_z{})\)&lt;/span&gt; and rotation &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((\omega_{x}, \omega_y{}, \omega_z{})\)&lt;/span&gt; of the planar retina. Coupled with the optic flow equation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\begin{pmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \dot{y}\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{z} \begin{pmatrix}-f &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; x\\ 0 &amp;amp; -f &amp;amp; y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}{v_x{}}\\ {v_y{}} \\{v_z{}}\end{pmatrix}+ \frac{1}{f} \begin{pmatrix} xy &amp;amp; -(f^2+x^2) &amp;amp; fy\\ f^2+y^2 &amp;amp; -xy &amp;amp; -fy \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \omega_{x}\\ \omega_{y}\\ \omega_{z} \end{pmatrix}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we were able to simulate the &lt;em&gt;perceptual&lt;/em&gt; effects of postural geometry: Changes in eye height and forward translational speed that would occur when a child changed from crawling to walking altered the pattern of retinal flow &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((\dot{x}, \dot{y})\)&lt;/span&gt; in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has lain dormant for a few years, but I now want to pick it back up. In short, there are a handful of perception/action systems that provide the nervous system with deterministic, causal information about the effects of different actions. These must be important for development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next step, I’m looking for a concise, but thorough parameterization of body posture that includes the eyes, head, torso, arms, and legs. Here’s a sketch of what I have in mind for the upper parts body that have the greatest impact on the direction of visual fixation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Body part&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Parameter(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$&lt;em&gt;{rx}, &lt;/em&gt;{ry}, &lt;em&gt;{lx}, &lt;/em&gt;{lx} $&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Head&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\theta_x{}, \theta_y{}, \theta_z{}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Torso&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$_x{}, _y{}, _z{} $&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupled with the distance between the eyes, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;, the radial distance to the head’s center of rotation, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the distance from the head’s center of rotation to the torso’s center of rotation, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can compute the effects of eye, head, and torso movement on visual motion at the two retinae. Now, if the &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt; signals from eye vs. head vs. torso can be distinguished, then these could couple with other proprioceptive (muscle, tendon, cutaneous) signals to provide a powerful set of &lt;em&gt;sensory&lt;/em&gt; signals that are directly caused by eye, head, and torso motion. See &lt;a href=&#34;../the-webs-we-weave/&#34;&gt;this earlier post&lt;/a&gt; for a causal graph that elaborates on this point. I’ll discuss why I think there are &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt; differences in the effects of eye and head motion in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step is to ask my colleagues in kinesiology if there is a canonical parameterization of body position that I can build upon. If you know of one, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been ‘sketching’ out conceptual models for some time without realizing that there is an entire field of analysis where these sorts of diagrams are the starting point: Causal modeling. My introduction to this world was Judea Pearl’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1548436587&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+book+of+why&#34;&gt;The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect&lt;/a&gt;. Interested casual readers might also enjoy Steve Sloman’s excellent and delightfully clear &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Causal-Models-People-Think-Alternatives/dp/0195394291/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1548436730&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=steven+sloman&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Causal Models: How People Think About the World and Its Alternatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to build a model for how an observer perceives visual motion given various possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure implies that motion on the retina comes from the movement of objects in the environment, movement of the observer, specifically the eyes, head, or body, or a combination of any of these. Eye movements stem from eye movement commands; head movements (translations and rotations) stem from head movement commands; body movements stem from commands to move the body. Movements of the eyes, head, or body generate proprioceptive signals from the eyes, head, and body. These signals derive from muscle, joint, and tendon receptors. Rotational and translational motion of the head stimulates vestibular signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that retinal motion caused by the observer has multiple non-visual correlates (or consequences) that are detectable under typical circumstances. There may also be differences in the specific &lt;em&gt;properties&lt;/em&gt; of motion caused by eye, head, body, or object motion. We’ll discuss these in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the task for perception is to answer the question: What’s moving and why?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>QSL? QSL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, my friend Mike (N3LI) and I made our first-ever CW QSOs.
In ham-speak, that means we chatted using Morse code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t fast, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t copy each other completely.
But we exchanged meaningful information using a classic communication mode that is no longer a requirement for licensing but is still going strong.
It was great fun, and we plan to keep practicing and plan to meet-up again next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-learning Morse code has reinforced several things for me.
Patience and persistence are the most important qualities for long-term mastery of any difficult skill.
And it&amp;rsquo;s good to give older brains a tough, but realizable challenge.
Especially when there are concrete and visible measures of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any no-code hams out there who haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the plunge, come on in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New lab logo</title>
      <link>/post/new-lab-logo/</link>

      <guid>/post/new-lab-logo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how many years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted a lab logo.
I thought that designing a logo was something that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; student might actually enjoy doing.
But I never pushed or insisted, and so it never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as a byproduct of a bunch of reading I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing about causal modeling and the philosophy of science, I came up with a figure that seems to work on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/nested-causality.jpg.png&#34; height=150px/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outer circle represents the world, the next circle the body that is embedded in the world, the next the nervous system embedded in that body (in the world), and the smallest the mind embedded in the brain (in the body in the world).
The world, body, and brain are directly measurable in various ways.
The mind is not.
We infer properties and structures of the mind indirectly, through patterns of brain activity or peripheral physiology or behavior.
The focal point of psychology as a science is making inferences about something that cannot be directly measured.
This is one reason psychology is harder than physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure has other associations.
It is similar to one used to demonstrate that rotational motion in 2 dimensions can evoke the perception of an object in 3 dimensions &amp;ndash; something called the stereokinetic depth effect (SKE).
It evokes the perception of a cone-like shape protruding up and to the left.
And it evokes a weaker perception of a tunnel.
I study depth perception and motion perception, so these features make the figure even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the figure could be viewed as a large letter O, for openness, something I now embrace in all aspects of my scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confess that I was just trying a new way to depict the embedded causal relationships among mind, brain, body, and the environment and found a color scheme I liked.
The rest was purely accidental.
But I guess invention is like that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;
