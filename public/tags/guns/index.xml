      <description>we fear the people who love their guns more than we love our children.
the atheist prays every day to gods she finds incomprehensible:
Remove the sticks of destruction from our arsenals and minds. Banish them to etnernity. Cleanse us that we may be clean.
a merciful god would hear this supplicant, know her grace,  and answer in the affirmative. a god who loved his children would, she thinks and hopes.</description>
