      <description>I’ve been developing an R package that interacts with the Databrary.org API. If you’re curious, you can download the databraryapi package from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi.
Like many people in the software world, I’m entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience. But my R package development skills are entirely self-taught.</description>

      <title>Ethical data sharing</title>

      <description>Video recordings pose challenges for data sharing. They contain faces and voices that cannot be easily eliminated or altered without harming the value of the recordings for other researchers. My colleagues and I developed a data sharing policy framework for Databrary that requires researchers to gain consent to share from research participants and restricts access to institutionally-approved researchers. Databrary&amp;rsquo;s template sharing release (permission) language may be found here, and some draft language relevant for gaining permission to share identifiable in the context of the EU&amp;rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may be found here.</description>
