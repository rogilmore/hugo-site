      <description>I was licensed as a Tech+ in 1993, but was never really active. Kids and finishing grad school were higher priorities. After reading &amp;ldquo;Seveneves,&amp;rdquo; I got the bug again and took both the Technician and General in the space of a couple of weeks in the summer of 2016. With the moral support of some fellow club members and a helpful Elmer, I upgraded to Extra in July of 2017.</description>
