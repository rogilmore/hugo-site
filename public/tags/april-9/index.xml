      <description>America needs a holiday dedicated to reflecting on the many ways we have failed to meet our founding ideals. We need such a holiday to reconcile the past with our common hopes for a better future, to &amp;lsquo;bind up the Nation&amp;rsquo;s wounds&amp;rsquo;, as Lincoln suggested in his second inaugural address. I suggest we make April 9 that day.
Lee surrendered to Grant on April 9, 1865 in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, a month after Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s second inaugural.</description>
