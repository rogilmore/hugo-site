      <description>I’ve been developing an R package that interacts with the Databrary.org API and with Datavyu annotation files stored locally or on Databrary alongside shared videos. If you’re curious, you can download the databraryapi package from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi.
Like many people in the software world, I’m entirely self-taught. Ok, I took a class in C programming at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Graduate School in the year before I applied to graduate schools in cognitive neuroscience.</description>
