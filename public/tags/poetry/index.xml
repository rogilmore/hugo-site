      <description>Some rascal or rogue Stashed kryptonite Upon my person.
Perhaps in that fingertip pocket of my Leviâ€™s, Or the underside of the spare button on that green and black plaid shirt, Or the tunnel in my underwear that no man uses I assure you but most boys try at least once.
I have always loved flying And nerdy girls. I have been underestimated by villains, And see beneath the surfaces of things.</description>
