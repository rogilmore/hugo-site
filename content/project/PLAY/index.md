The Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project will provide a first-ever glimpse inside the homes of almost 1,000 families across the U.S. 
We will collect, annotate (code), and openly share on [Databrary](https://databrary.org) video recordings of mothers and 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old infants engaged in natural behavior in their homes.
