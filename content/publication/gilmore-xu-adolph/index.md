abstract = "Psychologists embrace the ethical imperative of protecting research participants from harm. We argue that sharing data should also be considered an ethical imperative. Despite potential risks to participantsâ€™ privacy and data confidentiality, sharing data confers benefits to participants and to the community at large by promoting scientific transparency, bolstering reproducibility, and fostering more efficient use of resources. Most of the risks to participants can be mitigated and the benefits of sharing realized through well-established but not yet widespread practices and tools. This chapter serves as a how-to manual for addressing ethical challenges in sharing human data in psychological research in ways that simultaneously protect participants and advance discovery."
