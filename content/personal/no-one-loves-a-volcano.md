<p>spewing strangling gas</br>
red white vapor paints green grass gray.</p>

<p>unlovely lava flows -- entrails of eviscerated Earth -- </br>
that true when cool replenish tired soils.</p>

<p>and also true his indigestion soothed by some poison belch -- </br>
by gravity's hand sculpts the quieted cone into a shape most grand.</p>

<p>Still, I pity.</p>

<p>We misunderstand the flaming ash hole.</br>
We fear. We blame.</p>

<p>When it is the foul deep,</br>
Hades black bile,</br>
that forces its stench upward,</br>
ripping open his closed throat to spray</br>
things unwelcome here.</br>
Eruptions set his head afire.</p>

<p>He stands singly, wearily awaiting the next assault, wearing hermit's dread.</br>
Who will cool the dragon heart? And when?</p>
