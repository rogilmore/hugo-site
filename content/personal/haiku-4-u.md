<p>One last time, Dad says.</br>
Jason squeals ands bolts inside</br>
the mister. Slippery guy.</p>

<p>The audacity</br>
of giant metal tin-men</br>
shames the humbler heart.</p>

<p>What are crab cheese fries?</br>
Regular with seasoning?</br>
Do they sell? Who knows?</br>

<p>The didgery-dude</br>
took a raincheck. See, honey,</br>
I should have bought one.</br>

<p>Nittany Lion</br>
mating calls echo 'cross the</br>
Borough. Love me, do.</br>
