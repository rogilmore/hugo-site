I grew up in Denver, Colorado then headed East to go to college. 
In 1985, I earned my B.A. in Cognitive Science at Brown University. 
After graduation, I worked in Washington, DC for several non-profit organizations (70001 Training & Employment Institute, D.C. Cares, the International Neural Network Society) doing fundraising, public relations, non-profit marketing, and volunteer management. 
For a short time I was an international trade and public affairs consultant with Tucker & Associates. 
In 1992, I started graduate school, earning my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University where I focused on developmental cognitive neuroscience. 
I also participated in the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) Graduate Training Program. 
My family and I moved to State College in 1997. 
I am married and have two grown daughters.
