I was licensed as a Tech+ in 1993, but was never really active. 
Kids and finishing grad school were higher priorities. 
After reading "Seveneves," I got the bug again and took both the Technician and General in the space of a couple of weeks in the summer of 2016. 
With the moral support of some fellow club members and a helpful Elmer, I upgraded to Extra in July of 2017.

I enjoy VHF special event support and help run a local EmComm net. I'm doing my best to chase DX on 20 and 40 m using a barefoot IC-7300 and a multiband dipole.

To help with our local APRS coverage, I also run a fill-in digipeater/I-Gate.

I still have ambitions of (re)learning code and doing QRP SOTA and POTA type of activations as a way to combine my love of outdoor activities (hiking, cycling, and paddling) with ham radio.

My local club is the [Nittany Amateur Radio Club](https://https://nittany-arc.net/).
I check-in to the Western PA D-Star net occasionally, and often monitor the 146.85 W3YA repeater and the Yaesu System Fusion AmericaLink reflector.
