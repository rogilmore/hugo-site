For fun, I like to walk, run, hike, backpack, kayak and ride my bicycles: a Specialized Hybrid that I sometimes use to commute to work, a Specialized Allez road bike, and stoker-willing, a Hokitika road tandem we call Tonya.
In 2018 to celebrate our 25th anniversary, my wife and I took a tour of southern Tuscany with Vermont Bicycle Tours (VBT).
I'm what some might call a "half-fast" cyclist.
