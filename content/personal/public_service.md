I have been involved in local politics, serving as clerk and Judge of Elections in my State College precinct and now Majority Inspector. 
I was a moderate Republican at one point, but changed parties after the 2000 election.

My wife and I were formerly Democratic Precinct Co-chairs.

I'm especially proud of the work that led to the construction of the [Bellefonte Central Rail Trail](https://www.traillink.com/trail/bellefonte-central-rail-trail/).
It was one of our community's constructive responses to 9/11.
Just weeks after the attack, more than 100 volunteers cleared the first overgrown section of railbed.

I currently serve on the State College Borough Transportation Commission.
In a previous rotation on the Commission, we helped implement traffic calming speed humps in the Highlands neighborhood, pedestrian lead times in the downtown district, and plan for a set of bike lanes.
