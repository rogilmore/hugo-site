there are no heroes</br>
in this comic book,</br>

but everyone wears a costume,</br>
good guys and bad.</br>

or worse a mask that fools none but</br>
mothers

who play along 

complicit in their love.

at stake stands no less

the world,

the lives of innocents,

the child in distress.


super powers, super powerful

warp their wielder's character

move mountains, oh yes, but

who, I ask who will remove the rubble?

we wear kryptonite because it is the fashion

and a cape that does not billow when we do not fly.
