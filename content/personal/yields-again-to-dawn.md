a midnight glance proves</br>
that darkness dominates light.</br> 

the void swamps</br>
whatever twinkle or shimmer</br>
tickles our widened pupil.</br>

still...</br>

countless photons hurtle Earth-ward</br>
en route,</br>
as-yet-unseen in this space-time.</br>
we are but an unknown instant from</br>
some supernova or starbirth most spectacular.</br>

the stars steer our course,</br> 
not the depths they swim in.</br>

even here-now on this goodly frame</br>
we cannot escape the nightly deep.</br>
it sows what shadows know, oh yes,</br>
but</br>
always,</br>
always</br>
yields again to dawn.
