some Wilburs inspire no spider-poets</br>
nor earn the love of Fern.

this pig shuns lipstick.</br>
his countenance admits no adornment.</br>

ears perky,</br>
hairs erect,</br>
nose for mayhem acute, undulled,</br>
taste for anything.</br>
</br>
Orwell's Napoleon commands our farm.</br>
cowed, we animals howl or growl</br>
assent to each assertion</br> 
of fat cat dogma.</br>
</br>
Ham? I am.</br>
you speak newspeak?</br>
come wallow in the mud and muck with me.</br>
it's warm; you're welcome.</br>
</br>
the swamp now drained,</br>
the reptiles slither</br>
hither</br>
not yon.</br>
