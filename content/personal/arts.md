My family and I have been involved theatre and music for a very long time.
Indeed, my wife and I met in a production of "South Pacific" with the Georgetown Gilbert & Sullivan Society (GG&SS).
I played "The Professor" if you can believe it.

Recent shows here in State College have included "Oliver!", "The Sound of Music," and "Sweeney Todd," with Singing Onstage, "Dracula", "The Survivor", and "Gypsy" with the [State College Community Theatre (SCCT)](https://scctonline.org/), and "The Memory of Water", "Harper Regan", and "Two Can Play" with [The Next Stage](https://www.facebook.com/thenextstageinc/) theatre company. 

I am a former president of SCCT.
I'm proud to say that my colleagues and I forced the owners of the Boal Barn to make essential repairs to the facility.

Behind the fearless leadership of Amy Farkas, I'm helping launch a new community theatre group called "Left of Centre."
Look for details soon.

Needless to say, I love to sing and dance. 
My wife and daugther are the instrumentalists, but I pick a banjo now and then or play a bit of harmonica or tin whistle.

My wife and I also enjoy volunteering with the [Acoustic Brew](https://acousticbrew.org/) concert series and attending shows.
Our folk music friends are pretty awesome, too.

When the spirit moves me, I write poetry.
And when I remember, I take photographs.
