My family and I have been involved theatre and music for a very long time.
Indeed, my wife and I met in a production of "South Pacific" with the Georgetown Gilbert & Sullivan Society (GG&SS).

Recent shows here in State College have included "Oliver!", "The Sound of Music," and "Sweeney Todd," with Singing Onstage, "Dracula", "The Survivor", and "Gypsy" with the [State College Community Theatre (SCCT)](https://scctonline.org/), and "The Memory of Water", "Harper Regan", and "Two Can Play" with [The Next Stage](https://www.facebook.com/thenextstageinc/) theatre company. 

I am a former president of SCCT.
I'm proud to say that my colleagues and I forced the owners of the Boal Barn to make essential repairs to the facility.

Needless to say, I love to sing and dance. 
My wife and daugther are the instrumentalists, but I pick a banjo now and then or play a bit of harmonic or tin whistle.

My wife and I also enjoy volunteering with the [Acoustic Brew](https://acousticbrew.org/) concert series and attending shows.
Our folk music friends are pretty awesome, too.

When the spirit moves me, I write poetry.
