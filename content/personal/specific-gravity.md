<p>the call always</br>
comes too early</br>
in the morning for anything</br>
but mischief</br>
or the baker</p>

<p>I know who's talking</br>
but not the language spoken.</p>

<p>hand on the bannister</br>
does not steady.

<p>the direction of gravity skewed</br>
by other forces of nature.</p>

<p>there now is down, but which way up?</p>
