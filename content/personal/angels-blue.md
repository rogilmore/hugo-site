Gods I've always viewed with skepticism,</br>
But, I met an angel named Shirley.</p>

<p>They don't wear wings, you know.</br>
Impractical indoors. Hard to fit under a winter coat. Showy.</br>
Too many feathers ruffled already.</p>

<p>Or halos.</br>
Lord knows we have enough of those.</p>

<p>Sensible shoes? You bet.</br>
Got to keep their footing sure.</p>

<p>Craig or Suzanne might play a little trumpet, but only in the municipal band.</p>

<p>And none of them want to wrestle, ok?</p>

<p>It's code blue in the ICU,</br>
and there are sacred jobs to do.</p>
