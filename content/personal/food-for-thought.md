yes she cranked the handle</br>
but the meat and potato man put his heart in the grinder</br>
and no one saved the pink spaghetti strands for chili.</br>

<p>
he could have had his cake and eaten humble pie</br> 
or worn it as a badge of honorable intent.</br>
instead he tasted just desserts that fate sandwiched</br> 
between margaritaville and a cheeseburger in paradise.

full of gumption Forest's mother disparaged the integrity of chocolates.</br>

I'll be the salt of your Earth.
