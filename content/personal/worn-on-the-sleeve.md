I used to envy those who carried</br>

their hearts

safe</br>
surrounded by the warm fellowship of the other organs.

worn on the sleeve

mine fits no item of clothing,

so rides exposed,

bumping into this sharp-edged

tongue, or that pointed 

remark.

but a bleeding heart is never really broken,

and worn there

it escapes its ribbed-cage.

on the lam, its every beat sucks in sorrow,

pumps out sweetness, the flow of life and its ebb.

worn there it shows itself to all and to me,

each and every ticking second,

that the time is always

now.
