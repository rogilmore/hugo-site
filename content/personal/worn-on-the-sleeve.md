I used to envy those who carried</br>
their hearts</br>
safe</br>
surrounded by the warm fellowship of other organs.

worn on the sleeve</br>
mine fits no item of clothing,</br>
so rides exposed,</br>
bumping into this sharp-edged</br>
tongue, or that pointed</br>
remark.

but a bleeding heart is never really broken,</br>
and worn there</br>
it escapes its ribbed-cage.</br>

on the lam, its every beat sucks in sorrow,
pumps out sweetness, the flow of life and its ebb.</br>

wristworn its hands waving,
it warns all and me,</br>
each staccato second,</br>
that the time is always</br>

now.
