![Execution of James Foley by ISIS](https://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408530010517/Screengrab-from-the-ISIS--011.jpg)

<p>Love of death and fear of life</br>
well describes the current strife</br>
in Babylonia today.</br>
Nihilism rules the day.
</p>

<p>And what persuades the nihilist?</br>
Nothing, save the gun or fist.</br>
So, honor life -- with every breath</br>
speak words that counter love of death.
</p>
