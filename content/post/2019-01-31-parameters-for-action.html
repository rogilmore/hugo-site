<p>Several years ago, Florian Raudies, Swapnaa Jayaraman and I published a <a href="http://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2015.7345450">paper</a> where we simulated the optic flow that infants would experience in different head/body postures. We computed cyclopian (one-eyed) flow on the basis of this schematic:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gilmore-lab/temple-2017-02-27/master/img/computing-flow.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here, the key parameters were the instantaneous translation <span class="math inline">\((v_x{}, v_y{}, v_z{})\)</span> and rotation <span class="math inline">\((\omega_{x}, \omega_y{}, \omega_z{})\)</span> of the planar retina. Coupled with the optic flow equation,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{pmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \dot{y}\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{z} \begin{pmatrix}-f &amp; 0 &amp; x\\ 0 &amp; -f &amp; y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}{v_x{}}\\ {v_y{}} \\{v_z{}}\end{pmatrix}+ \frac{1}{f} \begin{pmatrix} xy &amp; -(f^2+x^2) &amp; fy\\ f^2+y^2 &amp; -xy &amp; -fy \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \omega_{x}\\ \omega_{y}\\ \omega_{z} \end{pmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>we were able to simulate the <em>perceptual</em> effects of postural geometry: changes in eye height and forward translational speed that would occur when a child changed from crawling to walking.</p>
<p>This work has lain dormant for a few years, but I now want to pick it back up. I’m looking for a concise, but thorough parameterization of body posture that includes the eyes, head, torso, arms, and legs. Here’s a sketch of what I have in mind for the upper parts body that have the greatest impact on the direction of visual fixation:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Body part</th>
<th>Parameter(s)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Eyes</td>
<td>$<em>{rx}, </em>{ry}, <em>{lx}, </em>{lx} $</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Head</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\theta_x{}, \theta_y{}, \theta_z{}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Torso</td>
<td>$_x{}, _y{}, _z{} $</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Coupled with the distance between the eyes, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the radial distance to the head’s center of rotation, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, and the distance from the head’s center of rotation to the torso’s center of rotation, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we can compute the effects of eye, head, and torso movement on visual motion at the two retinae. Now, if the <em>visual</em> signals from eye vs. head vs. torso can be distinguished, then these could couple with other proprioceptive (muscle, tendon, cutaneous) signals to provide a powerful set of <em>sensory</em> signals that are directly caused by eye, head, and torso motion. See <a href="../the-webs-we-weave/">this earlier post</a> for a causal graph that elaborates on this point. I’ll discuss why I think there are <em>visual</em> differences in the effects of eye and head motion in a future post.</p>
<p>My next step is to ask my colleagues in kinesiology if there is a canonical parameterization of body position that I can build upon. If you know of one, let me know.</p>
