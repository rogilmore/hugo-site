I find Andrew Sullivan worth reading almost all of the time even if I disagree with him.
This [time](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/andrew-sullivan-establishment-will-never-say-no-to-a-war.html), I agree completely:

> "*...I simply do not believe that the West has the knowledge, the will, or the ability to shape the extremely complicated and endlessly vicious politics of the Middle East. And I defy anyone to show otherwise...*"

So, while I find the present occupant completly unfit for office, I applaud his announcement to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.
Let's get out of Afghanistan, too.

Maybe the next Congress will have the guts to exercise its Constitutional reserved power to declare war.
Bring the troops home.
